How a 'chopper on a stick' entered the federal election campaign,Deputy PM promises return of Nowra's chopper on a stick during election visit,2025-04-01 18:18:43,"An Iroquois 894 helicopter that stood proudly on a stick against Nowra's skyline for decades was removed in September 2023 due to safety concerns. For 17 months, there has just been a stick. But on the fourth day of the federal election campaign, Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles visited the ultra-marginal seat of Gilmore to promise the chopper would return to its stick. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail The removal sparked controversy at the time, with some locals demanding its return. Nowra's strong connection to the Australian Defence Force, through the HMAS Albatross air station and the nearby HMAS Creswell, has made the chopper a key symbol of the community's identity. Defence Minister Richard Marles in Nowra with Member for Gilmore Fiona Phillips. (ABC Illawarra: Romy Gilbert) ""We are very happy to support and announce that the chopper on a stick will be back,"" Mr Marles said on Tuesday. ""We are bringing the chopper back this is no April fool's joke either,"" Gilmore MP Fiona Phillips said. Ms Phillips won the seat in 2022 by 373 votes and delivered an important 77th seat to the Albanese government. She holds it with a margin of just 0.2 per cent. So against a fast-paced election schedule, Mr Marles — who is also the defence minister — found time early in the campaign to back in the Labor incumbent in the must-hold seat. The Iroquois 894 helicopter was taken off it's stick and sent away for repairs in September 2023. (Supplied: Three Pots Cafe) To avoid problems caused by weather and wear, the new chopper on the stick wo will not be the old Iroquois helicopter, but a full-size replica. ""I think this is a better outcome because you are not going to tell the difference in terms of looking at it — but what you will have is actually a fit-for-purpose object,"" Mr Marles said The stick and its new replica chopper will likely be moved to the other side of the Princes Highway. (ABC Illawarra: Romy Gilbert) Mr Marles could not put an exact figure on the cost of the refurbishment but said it would be delivered in the next year, with the cost absorbed by the Department of Defence. Showers meant the media conference for the announcement could not be held with the empty pole as a backdrop, but a break in the weather allowed the MPs to record a TikTok video to share the news. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage ""If we are re-elected we will also open consultation … to give people the choice. Do they want to have the Iroquois helicopter — the much loved helicopter — or would they prefer to see something more modern … like our SeaHawk Romeo helicopter that our squadron flies today?"" Ms Phillips said. Ms Phillips and Mr Marles both indicated they had a preference, but would not reveal their favourites. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. ""I do [have a preference] — funnily enough, I was talking to the chief of the Defence Force today, he does as well,"" Mr Marles said. ""But I'm not going to reveal that, because I don't want to influence. ""Our preference is for the preference of the Nowra community."" Shoalhaven Business Chamber president John Lamont welcomed the chopper's return. ""The fact that it's coming back in a more suitable fashion, one that will last, is really fantastic,"" he said. Whether ""old or modern,"" he said it represented the community's connection to Defence.

Teal candidate banned from hair salon over 'poor attempt at humour',Teal candidate banned from Sydney salon after making crude remark,2025-04-01 17:32:15,"Teal independent candidate Nicolette Boele has apologised for making an inappropriate remark to a teenage worker, which led to her being banned from a hair salon on Sydney's upper north shore. Ms Boele, who is trying to claim the seat of Bradfield from the Liberals, received a letter of complaint from the salon's owner last week after telling the 19-year-old employee that her haircut was ""amazing, and I didn't even have sex with you"". She confirmed the incident in a statement to the ABC. Ms Boele is trying to claim the seat of Bradfield in Sydney's upper north shore in the upcoming election. (ABC News: Liam Patrick) ABC News contacted the salon and was told the owner did not wish to comment. Ms Boele has become a well-known figure in the northern Sydney electorate of Bradfield, after running against former Liberal minister Paul Fletcher at the 2022 federal election and helping to secure a significant swing against him. With the high-profile incumbent now retiring, many in the Coalition are nervous the seat could be claimed by the teal hopeful, who is running against Liberal candidate Gisele Kapterian.  Ms Boele is among dozens of independent candidates backed by the Climate 200 fundraising vehicle. A spokesperson for Climate 200 declined to comment.

Posters of politicians and billionaires as Nazis slammed as 'vile',"McCormack slams posters of himself, Dutton, Rinehart and Palmer in Nazi uniforms",2025-04-01 16:33:58,"Former Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has slammed a display in a storefront window in southern New South Wales that depicts Coalition politicians and billionaires as Nazis. The series of posters portrays Mr McCormack, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, and business leaders Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer in German World War II army uniforms. The posters are on display in a storefront on Wagga Wagga's main street. Mr McCormack, the Member for Riverina, which includes Wagga Wagga, slammed the display. Michael McCormack is the Member for Riverina, and was the deputy prime minister from 2018 to 2021. (ABC News: Matt Roberts/file photo) Mr McCormack said on social media he was pictured alongside the Opposition leader and ""mining magnates"" in ""World War II-era German uniform … Iron Cross medals and Nazi eagle emblems have also been added"". He said he had alerted Mr Dutton's office about the display. ""He's not going to get bogged down with some vile window in a country main street that shouldn't have happened in the first place,"" he said. A pixelated version of Mr McCormack's poster has since replaced the initial image of him. The posters displayed at the front of an advertising business in Wagga Wagga have been reported to police. (ABC Riverina: Gary-Jon Lysaght) It comes after NSW hate crime laws were passed in February this year in response to a string of anti-Semitic incidents and an increase in hate speech. The federal government also passed the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill in 2023, which prohibits the use of Nazi symbols and other measures glorifying the Holocaust and terrorist acts.  Mr McCormack said he asked the police to investigate. Michael McCormack criticised his depiction as a Nazi in a Facebook post.  (Facebook) Deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley called the display ""abhorrent"" on social media. ""Social cohesion is at breaking point in this country. We have a crisis of anti-semitism,"" she said. ""This is hate speech, plain and simple."" NSW Police said they were notified of the display on Monday morning. A police spokesperson said in a statement that after seeking legal advice, it was determined the material did not break the Australian Criminal Code. The artist behind the display, Michael Agzarian, told ABC in a statement he had been a visual artist for more than 45 years, creating political and provocative art work. ""The fact is many, many people support my art by buying it, backing it, displaying it and sharing it,"" he said. ""Of course there are others who are offended or angered by it and that's their prerogative. ""Put simply, I endeavour to make the viewer think, engage and consider a different point of view. Labor campaign headquarters declined to comment, and Coalition campaign headquarters directed the ABC's questions to Mr McCormack.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-01/former-deputy-pm-slams-nazi-posters-wagga-shopfront/105121020
"Albanese won't budge on key US grievances, as Trump's 'liberation day' looms","Albanese won't budge on key US grievances, as Trump's 'liberation day' looms",2025-04-01 10:42:21,"An updated list of grievances published by the United States trade office has set its sights on Australia's pharmaceutical sector, biosecurity protections and laws requiring the social media giants to pay for news. But the prime minister has vowed none will be touched ""on my watch"", as the federal government toughens its language against the Trump administration. The annual US Foreign Trade Barriers report offers an itemised list of issues America believes are affecting its exports, from Algeria to Vietnam and almost everyone in-between. But with US President Donald Trump due to announce a fresh round of tariffs on April 2, dubbed ""liberation day"", the report highlights where the administration might seek to retaliate. The report names biosecurity ""barriers"" to US beef, pork, poultry, apples and pears, saying the US ""continues to seek full market access"" for fresh produce to be exported. Australia has particularly strict biosecurity laws to protect native wildlife that is vulnerable to foreign diseases that have largely been kept from Australian shores. For example, Australia prohibits US apples and pears based on concerns of several pests, such as the bacterial disease fire blight — which the report acknowledges, and contests. The trade report again raises concerns over Australia's pharmaceutical laws, which the US pharma industry has long opposed. And it raises the News Media Bargaining Code, legislated under the former Morrison government, which requires social media giants to support news organisations in recognition of the benefits they receive from news content hosted on their platforms. In a toughening of Australia's stance on the coming tariffs, Mr Albanese repeated on Tuesday morning that Australia would not weaken its laws to appease the US. ""The report has three things that are of concern, at least, to Australia: one is the news bargaining code, the second is pharmaceuticals and the third is biosecurity,"" Mr Albanese said. ""Those issues are not up for negotiation. ""Not on my watch. We will negotiate sensibly but we won't undermine the biosecurity system."" Opposition Leader Peter Dutton also ruled out negotiating on those issues. ""No, and I agree with the prime minister’s position, and I'd say this: I will stand up for our country's interests every day if I am given the great honour of being prime minister,"" Mr Dutton said. ""I'll stand up for our interest and negotiate the best possible outcome for Australia and I will not compromise on any of that for our country."" Australia is continuing to negotiate with the United States in an attempt to secure exemptions from any incoming tariffs, arguing that because Australia imports more than it exports to the US, it should not be penalised. However, that trade surplus argument was not enough to win exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminium imposed by Mr Trump last month, and the government is aware this argument might fail again. Australian officials continue to talk to their American counterparts, but Labor is reluctant to pay a substantial price to win an exemption from fresh US tariffs. But Australian negotiators are unwilling to offer any major concessions in order to strike a ""deal"" with Mr Trump, who has openly called for foreign nations to make offerings that would benefit the US in order to secure exemptions. Mr Albanese said today that weakening Australian laws to escape tariffs estimated to have a minor direct impact to the economy would be like ""cutting off our own nose"". Shadow Trade Minister Kevin Hogan said the Coalition expected the government to secure exemptions. ""With the way some of the officials are talking in the US, that's what we're hoping for … [But] it does appear the PM is hiding behind officials,"" he said. The Coalition maintains that Mr Albanese should have sought to meet with Mr Trump in person to put Australia's case.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-01/election-2025-albanese-tariff-trump-biosecurity-exemption/105121156
"Coalition promises to relax home lending rules, against regulator's urging","Coalition promises to relax home lending rules, against regulator's urging",2025-04-01 18:04:02,"The Coalition is promising to relax rules around approving home loans that it says will let more young people buy their first home. The financial regulator requires banks to add a safety buffer when considering whether someone applying for a home loan will be able to make their loan repayments. Currently that is set at a rate of 3 per cent above the loan interest rate. The serviceability buffer was raised to 3 per cent during the COVID pandemic when the official cash rate was at an all-time low of 0.1 per cent. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Shadow Housing Minister Michael Sukkar says it is out of date, and the Coalition will ensure it is lowered if it wins at the May 3 poll. ""Nearly 40 per cent of potential first home buyers are not able to get finance for a loan … primarily because of that serviceability buffer,"" Mr Sukkar told ABC Radio National. ""Now that we have elevated interest rates, a serviceability buffer that has not been flexible with those changes is just blocking Australians."" Shadow Housing Minister Michael Sukkar says the regulator's lending rules are overly restrictive. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) The Coalition says a ""one-size-fits-all"" rule to assessing serviceability is stopping tens of thousands of Australians from getting a home loan ""even when they can meet repayments with a prudent margin against unexpected future rate rises"". Currently, the financial regulator's priority is ensuring banks are not taking on too many risky loans, which dampens borrowing power. A federal inquiry is considering whether there's a need to ease restrictions on banks about how much they can lend out to first home buyers. The Coalition would change the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority's mandate to allow it to take borrowers into greater consideration. However, APRA's chair has urged that the serviceability buffer remains at 3 per cent, saying late last year household debt was already high relative to incomes, and higher than in other nations. ""This high household debt is a key vulnerability if adverse economic scenarios came to pass,"" APRA chair John Lonsdale said in November. Mr Sukkar said it was understandable to have a high buffer during COVID, but it should be responsive and react to the market. The shadow housing minister noted it was lifted from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2021 during the pandemic. The Coalition says it will also require APRA to adjust how loans backed by Lenders Mortgage Insurance are treated, so that people without access to ""the bank of mum and dad"" are not punished by higher borrowing costs. 1 /
of
6 In essence, the Coalition would seek to no longer require banks to hold more capital against LMI-backed loans, which sets a premium on those loans that leads to banks charging higher interest rates on them. The major banks and property groups have backed more relaxed lending rules. Treasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered APRA to disregard HELP repayments when assessing an applicant's ability to service their mortgage, if those debts are close to being paid off. Greens housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather said relaxing lending rules would only drive house prices up further. ""Forcing young people to take on massive debts they can't afford will just generate extra profits for the big banks. It is not a solution to the housing crisis. It's a disaster waiting to happen,"" Mr Chandler-Mather said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Coalition had almost a decade to act on housing and did not make it a priority, adding: ""It's pretty hard to work out exactly what it is that they're promising"". Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said he wanted young people to ""achieve the dream of home ownership that has vanished under the Albanese government"". All fields are required unless marked optional.

Bipartisan support to invest $150m for health training hub in SA,Coalition to match Labor's $150 million pledge to Flinders University healthcare hub,2025-04-01 10:18:46,"A $150 million investment into a new healthcare centre in Adelaide’s southern suburbs has received bipartisan support. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a re-elected Labor government would support a new $300 million ""Flinders HealthCARE Centre"" at Bedford Park, near Flinders Medical Centre. The federal government will invest $150 million in the yet-to-be-constructed 10-storey building, with Flinders University to fund the rest.  Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Opposition health spokesperson and SA senator Anne Ruston told ABC News Breakfast that the Coalition would also match the $150 million for the centre, describing it as a ""great project"". ""Really loved the fact they are focusing on workforce because one of the greatest challenges that we have seen over the last three years is just the lack of workforce,"" she said. Anne Ruston says the Coalition would match the $150 million pledge for the centre. (ABC News: Andy Kennedy) Mr Albanese said the ""state of the art"" health service would open up 10,000 health appointments and see 1,300 additional health professionals across a range of medical nursing and allied health fields graduate each year. ""When this is up and running, there will be able to be 100 patients supported by this facility at any time,"" he said. ""It comes on top of the investment that we made at the last election campaign to upgrade Flinders [Medical Centre] and you could see that infrastructure work underway nearing completion."" Flinders University hopes to begin construction on the centre in 2027. Anthony Albanese says the pledge comes on top of upgrades to the Flinders Medical Centre. (ABC News: Che Chorley) The announcement is within the key electorate of Boothby — Labor's most marginal seat in SA — held by first-term MP Louise Miller-Frost who is up against former Liberal MP Nicolle Flint. It also comes after the prime minister announced a $200 million federal investment to upgrade the St John of God Midland Public Hospital in Perth, within the key Labor seat of Hasluck. Federal Health Minister Mark Butler said the new centre would ""cut outpatient waiting lists in Adelaide's south by as much as a third"". ""We've got to build our workforce, so those numbers the Prime Minister went through are just critically important to ensure that this terrific hospital has the number of graduates it's going to need, and Noarlunga Hospital and other services in the southern suburbs will need to service the needs of a growing population that is getting older,"" he said. He said the $150 million was accounted for in the recent federal budget under the Pre‑election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. SA Premier Peter Malinauskas welcomes the healthcare funding pledge. (ABC News: Che Chorley) SA Premier Peter Malinauskas, who is being used on advertising material for federal Labor in Boothby, said the new HealthCARE Centre would ""help deliver the highly-skilled workers needed to staff our growing hospital system"". ""We're building the beds and now you're helping deliver the workforce and that will mean more people getting seen on time to get the best possible healthcare money can buy in a country as rich as ours and that's living up to the egalitarian ideal that no-one gets left behind, particularly in the most urgent time of need,"" he said.

'How can I survive?' Politicians confronted by voters doing it tough on Q+A,'How can I survive?' Politicians confronted by voters doing it tough on Q+A,2025-03-31 22:37:34,"A grieving widower and a job-seeker struggling to pay rent have directly challenged federal leaders on the employment market and financial assistance. Industry Minister Ed Husic and Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien faced a studio of Sydney voters on Monday night, as part of the ABC's Q+A program, which aired days into an election campaign being fought on cost of living and economic disadvantage. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Peter Carnegie is a single dad of two, working full time, after losing his wife to cancer in August. He challenged the panel: ""How can I survive when I'm working full time and on the Family Tax Benefit and still struggling to live?"" His 22-year-old son played caregiver to his mum and has never had a job. He struggled at school with dyspraxia. ""Now I need him more than ever, because he takes his little brother to and from school to extracurricular activities,"" Peter said. ""How can the government help him get a job when it seems no one wants to even give him an interview?"" Mr Husic acknowledged the grief and the struggle.  He said the government had boosted JobSeeker payments and indexed welfare payments, meaning single parents were more than $5,000 better off each year. ""Do I say that that sorts everything out and deals with all the issues? I'm not going to say that to you and I'm not going to look you in the eye and say that,"" he said. ""I appreciate there's a lot of things that have to line up to make life easier. But we are starting that process. Peter said he was ""fortunate"" to live with his parents. ""If we were living in the place we were living before, I'd be spending 70 per cent of my income on rent alone,"" he said. ""And then there's electricity, then there's gas, then there's food, then there's petrol, there's car insurance."" Mr O'Brien told Peter: ""I don't know how you've done it, mate."" ""When you do hear the Coalition talking about the need for a stronger economy, all I can say to you is, please know that is also speaking directly to you,"" he said. A new Q+A/YouGov poll released today revealed just 12 per cent of Australians think they're better off now compared to 12 months ago. Around four in 10 respondents said they were worse off. Fiona Cameron said she had been on JobSeeker for more than a year. The 51-year-old shared a flat with two others, with rent jumping $275 in just two years. ""It is incredibly difficult,"" she told the Q+A panel, questioning Ed Husic on why the ""pittance"" JobSeeker rate hasn't increased during the recent years of high inflation. ""The government went to the 2022 election promising 'no one left behind'. They left a million people behind on day one of the campaign with a flat-out refusal by the prime minister,"" she said. Mr Husic said previous welfare payment increases, the government's ""full-throated"" advocacy for higher wages and capping the cost of medicines ""will lighten the load for people"". But he admitted: ""The things I'll say won't necessarily wash well with you."" Mr O'Brien said he was ""shocked"" by the rental increases Fiona had faced. ""To be honest with you, the stronger the economy we have, then the more options can be explored,"" he said, referring to future changes to welfare payments. ""The Coalition's focus is a laser one to get prices down."" Look back on our blog to see what people thought during Monday's episode. By Maddy Morwood Thanks for joining myself and Tessa tonight! PK has asked the three panelists to share something positive after an evening of intense politics, so I thought I'd share them in the blog. O'Brien said family was everything, and to hold onto loved ones tight. Husic said he couldn't wait to get married after the election. Sathanapally said she would rather be in Australia than anywhere else. We hope you enjoyed our companion live blog!  Remember, you can later stream this special episode of Q+A on ABC iview. To stay up to date, download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts. By Maddy Morwood I'm just going to take a moment to ask you look at the new polling commissioned by Q+A from YouGov in the wake of last week's budget. Just 12% say they are better off than they were 12 months ago, while more than four in 10 report being worse off despite easing inflation across the country. By Maddy Morwood PK has asked Sathanapally to answer Adrien's question about housing affordability, and she makes some really interesting points about how the problem has been in the making for three decades. ""No-one is off the hook. Neither major party. Everyone has their role to play in it,"" she says. ""No-one's going to like this answer, but there was a period where money was made really, really cheap, and the consequence of that was the prices got very high very quickly, and they're not coming back down."" She says fixing a problem that's taken decades is ""going to take time"" but one of the major problems is that we haven't been building enough houses. She mentions the tax side of the argument, which PK says they will be saving for another show. Hey, it's a mammoth topic! By Maddy Morwood Our next question is from Adrian Theseira. He says Australia's wealth inequality has escalated over the past two decades. When will the government stop this redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the ultra-rich by introducing serious wealth taxes and start significantly lowering taxes for the working class in order to give us regular Aussies a fair go at owning a home? By Maddy Morwood Audience member Fiona spoke directly to the politicians on the panel about her experience being on JobSeeker and why the government cannot not use the same solutions as it did during the pandemic. Watch the full conversation here: Q+A: Why won't the government raise Jobseeker? By Maddy Morwood In response to Fiona's question, Sathanapally says that JobSeeker is simply ""too low"" and suggests that the payments should go up, but not quite to the level of the aged pension. Husic, in response, said he was conscious things he was about to say ""won't necessarily wash well"" with Fiona. ""Rent assistance will never cover, and has never been designed to cover, the entirety of rent. It is designed to contribute."" In comparison to COVID-19 payments, he reminded the audience the pandemic was a ""once in a generation impact"". O'Brien's reply was the same as it was to the previous audience member: strengthening the economy. By Maddy Morwood Our next question is from Fiona Cameron.  She's asking about JobSeeker matching the aged pension. Why won't the government raise the rate of JobSeeker to match the pension? The government went to the 2022 election promising no-one left behind. They left a million people behind on day one of the campaign with a flat-out refusal. Why was it so important to Labor to demand payments be increased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but so easy to return to the pittance amount paid and then tell us to be grateful for the paltry inconsequential increase in rent assistance? By Maddy Morwood Everyone was pretty moved by audience member Peter Carnegie sharing how his family have been struggling. Watch it in full here: Q+A: How families are struggling to survive with rising cost of living By Maddy Morwood In response to Peter's question, Ed Husic says Labor is ""fair dinkum about making life easier while people are trying to get work"" in the current economy. ""One of the first things we did as a government was to lift JobSeeker and the indexation and those changes will deliver over $5000, and over $7,500 for single parents, women in particular,"" he said. ""I'm not going to look you in the eye and say that sorts out all your issues,"" he adds. Husic says Labor is committed to ensuring the next generation in particular is ""trained, skilled up and ready for work"" through Labor's Fee-Free TAFE legislation. O'Brien echoes Husic's empathy. ""When you hear the Coalition talking about the need for a stronger economy, please know this is also speaking directly to you, because we need to get the prices down."" By Tessa Flemming Audience member Peter Carnegie recounts his story of losing his wife to cancer last year and supporting his family as a single parent to an 8yo and 22yo. His question is about job opportunities.  The 22-year-old has never had a job as I needed him to take care of his mother while I was at work. He is now struggling to find a job. He is on JobSeeker, however, it just seems to be a tick box to get the payment. How can the government help him get a job when it seems no-one wants to even give him an interview?  And how can I survive when I'm working full time and on the family tax benefit and still struggling to not live beyond my means? By Maddy Morwood ""A little bit,"" says Toby Ralph, consultant and former Liberal campaign strategist. ""I think people would be more interested in what he's going to do to lower the price of groceries,"" said Lidija Ivanovski, consultant and  former Labor political adviser. In response to the question, O'Brien says this: ""You ask Peter Dutton a question, he gives you an answer."" ""I don't really give a heck,"" Husic said. Instead, he said? ""We need to build more homes,"" he said, encouraging the conversation around housing affordability. By Maddy Morwood Peter Dutton says that if becomes prime minister, he and his family will reside at Kirribilli House in Sydney, rather than at The Lodge in Canberra. He also says there will only be one Australian flag under a Coalition government. Audience member Peter Wallace from Pelican Waters asks: Why should Australia have only one national flag yet have two national Capital cities — one in Canberra and one in Sydney? By Maddy Morwood Grattan Institute CEO Aruna Sathanapally has reminded the audience that experts have concluded that, right now, nuclear is not plan A for Australia, and probably not plan B either. ""It's not that we are anti-nuclear,"" she says. ""It is entirely sensible for us to ask the question, is there a better way we could be doing this?"" ""The answer is no, not for Australia. ""For Australia, nuclear will be much more expensive than other alternatives we have. And, in particular, the type of technology that has been floated as possible, we haven't seen done yet"". By Maddy Morwood ""In a nutshell, it costs too much, it delivers too little, and it arrives too late."" That was Ed Husic on his stance on nuclear energy. By Maddy Morwood In response, Ted O'Brien diverts attention by saying the Albanese government has run away from its energy modelling from the last election. ""Now, we have the government of the day at sea without a compass, amidst some very choppy waters on energy,"" he says. ""I think the question was about nuclear,"" Husic interrupts, to a round of applause. In answering the nuclear query, O'Brien says the Coalition has already released a lot of information about the policy, including costings. ""In terms of costings, we've been very clear that it's up to $120 billion that will be for the nuclear program,"" he says. ""Is waste included in that? Yes. ""What approach did we take to that? The same approach which is taken right across the world in comparable companies."" He adds that the nuclear companies will pre-pay for the disposal of the waste, which is the exact same modelling as the Frontier Econonmics approach. By Tessa Flemming Audience member Cheryl McArthur  has quizzed Ted O'Brien on the Coalition's nuclear costings. We've been hearing a lot of general promotion from the Liberal Party about nuclear as a possible source of power for Australia, until it was barely mentioned in the budget reply, a time when we might have expected to hear some sort of detail on the cost. My question to Ted O'Brien is will the cost of storing the waste for an eternity be included in the costings when/if the costings are ever provided? By Maddy Morwood There's a lot going on between O'Brien and Husic as they argue over the Labor government's gas policies. CEO of Grattan Institute Aruna Sathanapally reminds the audience that gas is a ""small portion of our electricity"" and is now more expensive due to conditions outside all of our control. You can watch a snippet of it here: Q+A: 'Glut of greed': Federal politicians argue over the Labor government's gas policies By Maddy Morwood Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien says he is ""proud""  the Coalition has disagreed with Labor's approach to gas and says that we need ""more gas in Australia"".  ""If Australia wants to ensure that we still have sovereign capability in manufacturing, we have to stop what is happening now, which is the suffocation of gas supply."" 'We need more gas, we need to get it out of the ground, we need to get it where it needs to be,"" he says, referring to Peter Dutton's gas policy. Gas reservation is a key part of Dutton's energy pitch as the Coalition seeks to offer an energy policy with more immediate impact than its long-term nuclear policy. Minister for Industry & Science Ed Husic says Labor's gas market interventions was designed to shield people from huge gas increases or price increases. ""The facts show that we shielded people from the worst of the gas increases,"" he says. He says that in 2022 it wasn't a shortage of supply, but a ""glut of greed"" that caused price rises. By Tessa Flemming Audience member Sara Lin starts by asking about the Coalition's stance on Labor's gas market interventions. The Coalition previously opposed Labor’s gas market interventions. Is this proposed policy tailored towards manufacturing-heavy electorates rather than actual real energy policy? By Tessa Flemming Hi there and welcome to our Q+A live blog.

Bob Brown Foundation launches legal challenge against PM's 'rushed' salmon bill,Bob Brown Foundation lodges legal challenge over Anthony Albanese's 'rushed' salmon bill,2025-03-31 16:59:19,"The Bob Brown Foundation has lodged a fresh legal challenge in the federal court over the future of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour, as the topic becomes a heated federal election issue. Last week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese amended environment laws to protect ""sustainable salmon farming"" and guarantee aquaculture operations in the harbour on Tasmania's west coast. Anthony Albanese (right) and his Labor government passed the environmental amendment in the final days before the election was called. (X: Anthony Albanese) The laws, tabled by Labor and backed by the opposition, reduce the ability of environmental groups to challenge earlier approvals. A dead fish used as a prop in the Senate and a Hollywood superstar's intervention on the day a new law to protect salmon farm jobs in Tasmania is passed. On Monday, the Bob Brown Foundation (BBF) lodged an application to review the legislation, saying it does not believe the laws ""apply"" to fish farming on the harbour. ""This rushed bill was intended to protect the three foreign-owned corporations from environmental protections for the Maugean skate, which is on the edge of extinction, and to try to win Labor the seat of Braddon,"" BBF campaigner and Greens candidate for Lyons, Alistair Allan, said. ""… Our barristers will argue that Albanese's carve-out for polluting salmon farms does not apply to Macquarie Harbour. ""We are also asking the court to rule that, after 16 months [of] delay, the Minister for Environment Tanya Plibersek must make a decision regarding the original approval of fish farming."" Tasmania's aquaculture industry has well and truly rocketed to prominence, with even Hollywood actors weighing in. The BBF argues a clause in last week's amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act requiring ""the way in which the action [fish farming] is being taken has been ongoing or recurring for at least five years"" does not apply to farmed salmon operations in Macquarie Harbour as aquaculture operations there changed significantly between 2012 and 2023. Greens federal candidate and Bob Brown Foundation campaigner Alistair Allan (centre) announced the federal court challenge. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke) The BBF argues lease arrangements, harvesting strategies, waste management and predator management, along with ""joint ventures to address environmental damage and making large changes in production levels and the amount of feed used"" are among some of the company operations that have significantly changed over the past five years. The seat of Braddon — which takes in Strahan, the Macquarie Harbour community where many are reliant on salmon farming jobs — is considered a key marginal seat in the federal election. Communities south of Hobart have protested against fish ""chunks"" washing up on swimming beaches. (Supplied: Neighbours of Fish Farming) At the heart of the issue is the future of the endangered Maugean skate, a stingray-like fish with a link to the dinosaur age found nowhere else, whose numbers have been impacted by dissolved oxygen levels in its Macquarie Harbour home in part attributed to salmon farming. Environmentalists have raised concerns after new data showed about 10 per cent of salmon farmed in Tasmania's Macquarie Harbour died during the process. In November 2023, the BBF was one of three conservation groups — along with the Australia Institute and the Environmental Defenders Office — that requested the federal environment department reassess salmon-farming approvals in the harbour. In its application to the federal court, seen by the ABC, BBF lawyers argued Ms Plibersek failed to reconsider aquaculture approvals in a time frame outlined by the EPBC Act, which they said was February 2024. In February, Mr Albanese intervened, promising a legislative fix for the industry. All three salmon companies operating out of Tasmanian waters — Brazilian multinational JBS, New Zealand's Petuna, and Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke, owner of Tassal — are owned by foreign multinationals. (Supplied: Bob Brown Foundation) At the time, he said the EPBC Act did ""not allow for a commonsense solution on an acceptable timeline"" and vowed to introduce legislation when parliament next sat, which was expected to not be until after the election. Those black, circular things floating in the water off the Tasmanian coastline? They are salmon farms. Here is how many there are — and who owns them. But the rushed law change has sparked outrage among the Greens and conservation groups. The ensuing parliamentary debate included a dead fish being brought into the chamber by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, and another politician calling Mr Albanese and the Labor Party a ""pack of mongrels"". During the debate, ACT senator David Pocock said he had seen legal advice that the new law would not achieve its aim, while Nationals senator Perin Davey said it would not give the industry ""the certainty they need"". Tasmanians have turned up in large numbers to rallies protesting aspects of the salmon industry. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke) Salmon Tasmania chief executive Luke Martin said he was not surprised by the BBF action and the industry ""expected"" a legal challenge. The continuation of the salmon industry is supported by both major political parties. There are 11 salmon farm leases in Macquarie Harbour. (ABC News: Magie Khameneh) The fast-tracked changes to national environment laws have angered Tasmanian communities negatively impacted by the salmon industry. Over recent weeks, multiple anti-salmon protests have taken place in the south-east of the state, drawing large crowds. The possible extinction of the Maugean skate has caused concern among environmentalists. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke) On Monday, Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff said he was concerned federal Labor would drop legislation protecting salmon farming if forced to govern in minority. Meanwhile, Tasmanian Liberal senator Jonno Duniam said the conservationists' challenge was ""very disappointing but not entirely surprising"". ""I should have bet my house on that actually happening,"" he said. ""You can be guaranteed the Bob Brown Foundation and other green activist groups will always lodge a legal challenge. The future of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour and the fate of the Maugean skate have become politically intertwined. (Supplied: IMAS) When asked whether the legal challenge was expected to stand up in federal court, a spokesperson for Ms Plibersek said it was unlikely. ""The department is yet to formally advise the minister, but we anticipate they will advise that the legislation that passed the parliament last week will apply to Macquarie Harbour. This would allow salmon farming to continue under its current environmental approval,"" they said. A spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said they did not comment on matters before court.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-31/bob-brown-foundation-to-challenge-salmon-bill-federal-court/105115990
Albanese says PM should live in Canberra as Dutton opts for Kirribilli — as it happened,Federal election 2025: Albanese says PM should live in Canberra as Dutton opts for Kirribilli — as it happened,2025-03-31 19:27:10,"The third full day of the 2025 federal election campaign was jam packed and included Opposition Leader Peter Dutton revealing he would not call Canberra home if he became prime minister and would live in Kirribilli instead. While in Perth with WA Premier Roger Cook, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese officially announced a $200m pledge to upgrade St John of God Midland Public Hospital in WA. The prime minister also had a slip of the tongue. When asked semi-unprompted at a press conference about how he would not go into a coalition with anyone, including the Greens, Mr Albanese said : ""If you ask me, 'Do you rule out governing in Coalition with the Greens?' the answer to that is no."" He very much meant to say yes. Meanwhile, Mr Dutton checked out a mining equipment facility in Newcastle before heading to Thargomindah, about 1,100 kilometres west of Brisbane, as floodwaters there rose. Take a look back at how the day unfolded with our blog. By Caitlin Rawling We will wrap up our live coverage here. Thank you for joining us on yet another jam-packed day of the 2025 federal election campaign blog. We will be back bright and early tomorrow morning but if you can't wait that long, you can check out the rest of today's  online coverage at our Australia Votes page. Thank you again for joining! By Caitlin Rawling Minister for Energy and Climate Change Chris Bowen has told 7.30 Labor has made no decision to move gas to the east coast through a pipeline. ""One of the things people talk about is a re-gasification terminal,"" he said. ""One way of getting gas from Western Australia to New South Wales is through a pipeline. ""There's been no decision made to do that. ""It would primarily be about moving gas around the country more efficiently. ""You can build pipelines but it might not be the most efficient way, it might be done by ship. ""Ministers have written to me saying it means gas imports, it means regasification terminals to facilitate gas around the country. ""It's one option AEMO could look at."" He also took aim at the Coalition energy policy and accused Peter Dutton of ""microwaving"" a Scott Morrison gas policy, which Bowen said would fail. ""It's clearly been done on the run, it's falling apart with the most basic of scrutiny,"" he told 7.30. ""[It] is a reheated, microwaved Morrison policy. ""Gas-fired recovery was announced by Angus Taylor in 2020, the day that he did that, gas prices were $4 a gigajoule. By the time of the election, they were $34.70. ""That's the carbon copy of what they're doing today. It's exactly the same, word for word."" By Samantha Dick The prime minister says Peter Dutton is intentionally avoiding discussions about abortion ahead of the election. Anthony Albanese made the comments during an appearance on pop culture podcast, Big Small Talk. When co-host Hannah Ferguson asked whether the opposition leader was trying to steer clear of abortion ""given his voting history on women's issues"",  Albanese replied: ""He has said himself that he's trying to do that. ""Abortion is something that is regulated by state and territory governments, that's true. ""But what my government's done is to address the whole issue of women's reproductive health, and the fact that it imposes a cost.""  Dutton has previously said while he supported ""a woman's right to choose"", abortion is a matter for state and territory governments. By Caitlin Rawling Earlier today, Oppositon Leader Peter Dutton and Nationals leader David Littleproud visited Thargomindah. Here are some pics of their tour. By Courtney Gould We're just a few days into the campaign trail, but early polling suggests the major parties will spend it neck-and-neck. But the ABC's chief digital political correspondent Jacob Greber says the Opposition Leader Peter Dutton ""has a big mountain to climb"". Polls suggest close contest in federal election By Defence correspondent Andrew Greene A veteran bureaucrat who is completing a government review of the Australian Submarine Agency has accused Malcolm Turnbull of undermining the country's chances of getting nuclear submarines. Former Defence secretary Dennis Richardson was one of several speakers invited by the former prime minister to address a security conference in Canberra that discussed the future of the US alliance and the AUKUS partnership. ""You're almost making the 'if' a certainty — that we won't get it,"" Richardson told Turnbull during the day-long forum held at the National Press Club. ""I think there's a good chance we will get it. It depends upon the degree of commitment that we have in this country and our preparedness to pursue it as a national enterprise, not as a defence project. "" ""Now, all right, we may fail, but I don't think the fact that we may fail should become a certainty that we will fail."" Richardson, who also served as Australia's ambassador to Washington, said AUKUS critics such as Turnbull were wrong to call for a Plan B such as buying French nuclear-powered submarines. ""If we're gonna go back to square one and start again, we have learnt nothing,"" he said. ""The French have had their problems with nuclear-powered submarines. They've had to, on a couple of occasions, get American assistance."" By Caitlin Rawling The first week of the official election campaign is well underway as both leaders take to the radio and another Chinese ship floats past Australia.

You can have your say by clicking on the link below and filling out the questionnaire. By Caitlin Rawling In a press conference earlier today, Anthony Albanese said he would ""prefer"" if the Chinese research vessel that Australia was monitoring wasn't in Australian waters, but he said that it was operating within international rules. ""This research vessel has not been a real secret for several weeks or even months. ""It's been operating out of New Zealand and has been cooperating with that country's scientists as they've done a series of deep-sea experiments off the New Zealand coast,"" Defence correspondent Andrew Greene told News Channel.

By Caitlin Rawling Former ACCC Chair Allan Fels says he thinks the ACCC will ""recommend the introduction of the European law and the UK law test of excessive prices. ""Their laws there prohibiting excessive prices across the board for all industry and I think we should do something like that, providing there are multiple safeguards to prevent the cure being worse than the disease,"" he told Afternoon Briefing. You can watch Fels's full interview below: Former ACCC Chair expects government to adopt EU laws to lower supermarket prices By Elissa Steedman Good Morning, There doesn't seem to be much commentary or any questions being asked on where and how the Nuclear waste from the proposed facilities will be managed. Does the $600 Billion dollar price tag to build the facilities include the waste management facilities required and does the price tag and proclaimed costs of energy savings include the ongoing management of storing the waste? Thanks - Batesy Hi Batesy, Thank you for your question. With regards to how nuclear waste from the Coalition's proposed plants would be managed, the question hasn't yet been settled. It's a question several countries are still grappling with, and something my colleague Megan Macdonald delved into in a recent article. You can read that piece here. By Caitlin Rawling Barbarba Pocock said to reduce energy prices we need to help households who are struggling first. ""We need to assist those households who want to move to electrification and for whom cost is as a barrier. ""We have a plan to assist small businesses and households to make that move to electrify their cook tops and their water heating systems. ""There's a lot of things that can be done immediately that will assist and in the long-run get us to where we need to [be] which is cheaper renewables that deal with the climate crisis and assist those households."" By Caitlin Rawling Michael McCormack was asked about the Coalition's plan to reduce energy prices as Dutton hasn't made it clear when this will come into play. ""What is in the table is our national gas plan and that will reduce energy prices and if you bring more gas into the market, that will lead to a reduction in prices,"" he told Afternoon Briefing. By Elissa Steedman Up now is the Grattan Institute's Tony Wood to unpack the debate over gas. He says most of the factors that influence the price of gas is are out of the government's control. ""They are weather-related or overseas-related, like the war in Ukraine, so government needs to be very careful in blaming someone for things that happened that they don't like or take credit for things they do,"" he says.  Wood says the question neither side has answered is laying out exactly how they will get the price down. ""The idea that we will reserve enough gas for ourselves and then we will export the rest sounds simple,"" he says. ""It is far from simple in practice."" He says while he is ""all for"" finding ways to reduce the cost of gas, he is not sure he's seen any clear policy from either side of government that would achieve that. If you'd like to read more about what the major parties have put forward, I broke it all down in this article last week. By Caitlin Rawling On Afternoon Briefing's panel this afternoon we have Greens senator Barbara Pocock and Nationals MP Michael McCormack. First up is a discussion about Peter Dutton's announcing he would ditch Labor's plans to co-host the COP 2026 summit with the Pacific Islands. McCormack, who is the shadow minister for the Pacific, says the Pacific knows where he stands, despite the Coalition wanting to cancel plans to co-host the summit next year. ""The Pacific knows full well we are their best friends and we will continue to be so,"" he tells Afternoon Briefing. Pocock disagrees and says: ""It is a step in the absolutely wrong direction."" ""If I think about the number of Pacific leaders who have been through our parliament in the last several years begging us to be more attentive to the existential crisis being created in Pacific nations through rising sea levels, through extreme storms. ""These are countries at the forefront of the climate crisis."" By Elissa Steedman A final question for Jason Clare.  Stephanie Dalzell notes the budget revealed expenditure related to the Youth Allowance payments is expected to decrease by almost $500 million over the next four years, which Treasury says is because less people are taking it up. She asks the minister to shed more light on the projection. Clare says he's ""not sure about the take-up rates"" but adds the government has increased funding over the last few budgets, as well as provided other cost of living support.  ""One of the things that a lot of students have asked me to assist with is financial support while they do their practical training, the practical part of a university degree. And on 1 July, paid practical or financial support for teaching years will start as well as nursing students as well as midwifery students and social work students. ""That is real financial support for students at university, and often they have to give up their part-time job or they have to move from one place to another in order to do that ... unpaid training. ... And the financial support will make a world of difference to a lot of students."" By Elissa Steedman The issue of deportation for people who have committed crimes in Australia but are stateless has risen again today. A man who was reportedly part of the cohort of immigration detainees released following the High Court's NZYQ ruling was shot by police overnight. It's alleged he ran at an officer while armed with a metal pole. Jason Clare is asked whether anyone in the NZYQ cohort has been sent to Nauru. ""We have acted as you would expect us to,"" Clare replies. ""The High Court said these individuals could not be detained and so we are taking steps, working with Nauru to make sure that people can be sent to Nauru. ""They are the actions you would expect us as a government to make."" He adds that Labor's plan is to ""make sure people who break the law are locked up"". By Elissa Steedman Stephanie Dalzell shifts to Labor's promise to combat supermarket price gouging.  She asks whether the government's proposal to set up a taskforce measures up to ""outlawing"" the practice. ""It will provide us with the advice we need for legislation we need to put in place the sort of fines to stop this happening,"" Clare says. ""In the UK they have done this, and Europe as well, they have done it in 30 states in the US where you can outlaw this and put in place the serious fines to stop the big supermarket chains doing this."" Jason Clare says outlawing supermarket price gouging can be done By Elissa Steedman Up first is Education Minister Jason Clare.  First up, he's asked whether voters should expect energy prices to go up when the government's latest round of rebates run out at the end of the year. Clare counters, saying voters can expect prices to go up under a Coalition government. ""What we know from the $600 billion nuclear reactor policy that is put in place is experts say power prices could go up by up to an extra $1000 a year,"" he says. ""These things will take 20 years to build."" Stephanie Dalzell presses him again. What if Labor wins? Clare says prices will be lower under Anthony Albanese than Peter Dutton.  He says Australia's coal-fired power plants need to be replaced in the coming years, and the cheapest and fastest way to do so is with renewables. Jason Clare claims higher power prices under a Coalition government",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-31/federal-election-2025-campaign-trail-monday-march-31-blog/105114698
Young Australians could contribute to a 'Trump bump' this election,'Labor must keep a close eye on this trend': inside the politics of younger voters,2025-03-31 13:45:50,"In his opening pitch for re-election, Anthony Albanese said: ""We don't need to copy from any other nation to make Australia even better and stronger. We only need to trust in our values and back our people."" It was Albanese's first, and I suspect not the last, attempt to evoke the image of Donald Trump and the chaos he is wreaking in the US and imply, but not directly say, that Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is attempting to borrow the same ideas and tactics here. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Asked if he was referring to Trump, Albanese said people would ""make their own judgements"". ""But people will have a look at the mass sackings of public servants,"" he said, referring to Dutton's promise to cull the Commonwealth public service by 41,000. In response, Dutton accused Albanese of starting a ""sledge-a-thon"" over Trump. Donald Trump does not poll well with younger Australians. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein) Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage There's a reason Albanese wants to handcuff Dutton to Trump and a reason why Dutton sees it as a smear. Around the world, a new phenomenon is emerging called the Trump bump — incumbents that talk tough on Trump and lean into their own country's sense of national pride are seeing political dividends. While incumbency was political cryptonite during the inflation crisis, Trump is giving incumbents their mojo back. As Donald Trump goads the US' partners and allies into a worldwide fight, there are signs Americans are losing faith in the president they hoped would bring them boomtimes. Trump is particularly toxic in Australia with younger voters, too. The 2025 federal election will be the first election where gen Z and millennials will outnumber boomers in every state and territory, dramatically changing the way political parties campaign and target voters. A study of voters aged 18-44, prepared for the John Curtin Research Centre by the RedBridge Group in March and shared exclusively with this column, is an eye-opener into what young voters really think on a range of issues. The ABC's politics podcast, Politics Now, dives into the biggest stories, giving you a balanced look inside the strategies and decisions behind the headlines. The survey finds that most gen Z and millennials in Australia do not want a leader like Trump, but those with a radical right political disposition do. The majority of Australian voters aged 18-44 say Australia would not benefit from a leader like Trump. Just 12 per cent say Australia would definitely benefit and 11 per cent say it probably would, coming to a total of 23 per cent on the yes side. Conversely, almost half (48 per cent) say Australia would definitely not benefit from a leader like Trump, and another 10 per cent say it probably would not (a total of 58 per cent on the side of no). Across all the social, economic and political groups analysed in this study, a plurality in almost every single group said that Australia would not benefit from a leader like Trump. Even among Coalition voters aged 18-44, a plurality demurred on a Trump-like leader (39 per cent said no, 36 per cent said yes). Indeed, even among the most populist quintile, a leader like Trump was not seen as beneficial for Australia (-28 per cent net yes). Gen Z and millennial voters will outnumber baby boomers on election day. Nick Dyrenfurth, executive director of the John Curtin Research Centre, said he commissioned Redbridge to look at gen Y and gen Z voters to understand their priorities and was not surprised by their attraction to anti-establishment politics. ""These cohorts have known little else other than economic flux, uncertainty and growing inequality since they entered the workforce, having been buffeted by the short- and long-term effects of the global financial crisis with a decade plus of anaemic growth, stagnant real wages and the housing affordability and supply crisis, all exacerbated by COVID,"" Dyrenfurth says. ""Overseas polls and election results have shown that young people are attracted to anti-establishment politics, from Argentina to Trump and left-wing strongholds like Sweden, and on the left expressed by fleeting support for [Bernie] Sanders and [Jeremy] Corbyn. ""Now we know that the rage and resentment they feel towards an economic system that they think is gamed against their generation — with much justification — is not a case of Australian exceptionalism."" What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. Dyrenfurth notes this trend was most pronounced with young men, the ""somewhat radical right quintile"" spikes notably for men in their mid-to-late 20s. ""Labor must keep a close eye on this trend in coming years,"" he says. In the survey, Dutton is more liked than Trump, less trusted than Albanese and scores a lower rating than US populist right podcaster Joe Rogan. The only two people in the list of names shown to respondents that have overall net positive trust scores are two former centre-left politicians: Barack Obama (+12) and former NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern. For Labor, there is danger with the Greens' Max Chandler-Mather and Adam Bandt scoring the most trust from these voters. The research shows that younger voters are not straightforwardly right-wing or left-wing or conservative or progressive. Young men across the world have been embracing right-wing politics, while young women have moved to the left. Will it happen in the Australian election too? ""They have highly progressive attitudes towards gender roles and issues like the death penalty,"" Dyrenfurth says. The most fascinating part of the findings is views on immigration. It shows that gen Z and millennial voters are generally not confident that governments in Australia will take actions that align with their interests and concerns on the policy areas they believe are most important, indicating widespread disillusionment with politics and the role of the state. Voters were least confident about: immigration (-42 per cent net confidence), economic inequality (-40), housing affordability (-36), crime and disorder (-35) and cost of living (-30). Dyrenfurth says that when understood in terms of housing availability and simple demand and supply or wage suppression, it makes sense to see scepticism. ""It is one thing to support immigration in principle but another when, unchecked, it smashes living standards, most importantly housing affordability,"" he says. ""That these generations are defined by their stress on material issues is confirmed by views on the salience of climate change, cost of living, the economy and housing.""

Albanese announces joint $355m upgrade to Perth hospital,Anthony Albanese announces multi-million-dollar joint upgrade to Midland Hospital,2025-03-31 11:53:07,"The prime minister has announced a joint multi-million-dollar upgrade to one of Perth's busiest public hospitals along with the WA government in an election pitch to voters, kicking off a week of health announcements. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Anthony Albanese arrived in Perth yesterday and held a media conference today to announce a joint $355 million upgrade to the St John of God Midland Public Hospital in Perth's east, in the key Labor seat of Hasluck, contributing $200 million if re-elected. Anthony Albanese arrived in Perth on Sunday and is expected to make more health announcements throughout the week.  (ABC News: Matt Roberts) The public hospital, operated under a public-private partnership between the WA government and St John of God Health Care, opened in 2015. Federal Labor told the ABC the commitment would deliver additional hospital beds, operating theatres, ICU and neonatal care beds and a redesign of the obstetrics and neonatal unit to serve the vastly populated area. The WA government would pick up the rest of the bill, contributing an additional $50 million after already committing close to $105 million to upgrade the Midland Health Campus's ED in February on the recent state election campaign trail.

Examining Labor's promise to ban supermarkets from price gouging,Labor wants to outlaw price gouging in supermarkets. How would that work?,2025-03-30 14:17:40,"Labor's first promise of the election campaign is to outlaw supermarket price gouging. The political intent is obvious, given voter anger over the cost of living. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was unsubtle in his retail appeal on Sunday morning, accusing supermarkets of ""taking the piss"" out of Australians. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail But the details of the announcement — in short, that a taskforce will consider options for a new law to ban unfair pricing practices — leave a lot unanswered. What exactly is price gouging, and what would it actually mean to make it illegal? Australian companies are already subject to some rules about price setting. There are laws against companies who are supposed to be competitors instead colluding to ""fix"" prices or otherwise seeking a mutual advantage. This is called ""cartel"" behaviour, and it is relevant in the supermarket sector with its two dominant players. Then there are laws to stop companies from acting in ""predatory"" ways to eliminate or harm their competitors, for example by holding prices artificially low for an extended period to undercut a rival. The government has vowed to set up a taskforce to investigate how to best make it illegal for supermarkets to price-gouge customers, if it wins the election. And finally, there are laws against misleading consumers about prices, including making false claims about the reason for a price hike. But there is no law to stop a company from raising prices simply to make a profit, and there is no law that says they can't take advantage of market power they have. The consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), has some power to promote competition: for example its newly bolstered powers to push back against large companies acquiring smaller competitors. But beyond that, to put it in terms similar to the PM, it is legal for companies to take the proverbial when they set prices. As the ACCC puts it: ""People may consider the prices a business charges to be too high. This is sometimes referred to as 'price gouging' or 'excessive pricing' … ""[But] While it's often seen as unfair, prices or price rises that people may think are too high are not illegal on their own."" Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Labor's proposal is for the ACCC, Treasury and market experts to form a taskforce and work up a model for a price gouging law, to be enacted by the end of the year. The first challenge for that taskforce will be to define price gouging, which is not straightforward — what is the line between ""legitimate"" and ""unfair"" profit-making? The PM swerved that question on the ABC's Insiders on Sunday, saying only that ""people know when they're being ripped off"". But there are precedents for the government to build on. Similar laws exist in the EU, the UK and in 37 US states. And Australia has gone down this path twice before in specific circumstances — once, during the Howard government, to prevent price gouging when the GST was introduced, and then during the Morrison government to prevent gouging on face masks. The Morrison government intervened after face masks were sold at large mark-ups by some retailers during the pandemic. (Reddit) In general, the test for courts to determine in price gouging laws is whether a price bears no relationship to economic fundamentals — for instance, a price hike that has nothing to do with a spike in supply costs. If a court could establish that, Labor says ""heavy fines"" would apply. But as is the case with other competition laws, which senior Labor sources suggested would be the starting point for this new law, court action would be a last resort. Before contemplating a lengthy legal process, the ACCC would have the power to issue a stop notice to a supermarket it believed was price gouging, asking them to stop, and could also issue infringement notices (effectively small fines). But even when it comes to lower-level actions such as a stop request or an infringement notice, the process of gathering evidence to establish price gouging would not be straightforward — which is why these laws are rarely used where they exist overseas. The consumer watchdog finds Australia's supermarkets are more profitable than their global peers and the two majors don't need to compete ""vigorously"", but the ACCC stops short of declaring grocery prices excessive. For example, the recent ACCC supermarkets report, for which the regulator had access to detailed information about their price-setting behaviour, did not land on definitive evidence that Coles and Woolworths had acted unfairly. It did find that their profit margins increased during the recent inflation spike, and found they used their significant market power to their advantage. But it swerved the question of ""gouging"" — a word which did not appear once in the 441-page report — and broadly resisted characterising price-setting as ""unfair"".

Politicians urge 'ratbags' to stay away after hecklers gatecrash campaigns,Politicians urge 'ratbags' to stay away after hecklers gatecrash campaigns,2025-03-30 11:34:33,"Security details on the campaign trail will be tightened after several hecklers were able to get close to the prime minister and opposition leader yesterday. One climate protester was able to get within arm's reach of Opposition Leader Peter Dutton at an event in Brisbane yesterday, and another two events were interrupted on the first full day of campaigning. This morning, Labor campaign spokesman Jason Clare revealed details of another incident that has caused concern for MPs. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Just before the campaign kicked off proper, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke was forced to pull out of an event over security concerns. Mr Burke was due to speak after prayers at Parry Park in Lakemba, which he has done ""from time to time"" for about 15 years. But organisers pulled him aside to warn a text message had been circulating in the community encouraging young men to visit the prayer room and make it known that Mr Burke was not welcome because of the government's position on the conflict in Gaza. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. The ABC understands there were a number of men at the event who were unknown to organisers. After a conversation with his security detail, Mr Burke agreed not to risk causing an escalation by addressing the group. One of the men attending later posted a video online warning Mr Burke he was not welcome. ""He has the audacity to come to speak to our community … and goes scurrying out the back exit,"" the man in that video said. ""I want you to know you are not welcome in our community."" The safety of MPs has become a growing concern at Australian election campaigns, with federal police warning last week that there had been 712 reports of threats to parliamentarians and other high office holders so far this year, which was on track to surpass previous years. ""In the past 13 weeks, we have charged six men, in five separate incidents for allegedly threatening parliamentarians and one man for allegedly threatening a political organisation,"" commissioner Reece Kershaw told senators last week. ""While these are concerning statistics, our febrile environment in Australia is similar to many other democracies."" Members of the public attempted to interrupt events held both by Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton. Politicians across the aisle have urged that Australia does not go down the path of other nations like the United Kingdom or United States, where politicians are limited from being able to engage with the public. In the past decade two British politicians have been murdered in stabbing and shooting attacks while engaging with the public, and in the US now-President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt while at a campaign rally in Pennysylvania. Labor's campaign spokesman said people needed to treat each other with respect. ""I think all of us would agree that we're lucky in Australia we haven't seen what's happened in the US or UK,"" Mr Clare told Sky News.  ""That's not how democracy is done in Australia. This shouldn't be the way elections happen. ""You should be able to go about your day, talk to people, encourage them to vote for you and if they don't want to vote for you there is somebody else."" Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Coalition campaign spokesman James Paterson said heckler activity diverted police resources that should be out fighting crime. ""I'm very concerned about this … because it comes in the context of the federal police saying threats to parliamentarians are the highest they have ever been,"" Senator Paterson told ABC Insiders. ""I don't think we want to move to a style of politics we see in some other countries where our political leaders are cocooned in a security bubble and can't interact with Australians. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had confidence in the AFP, and said protesters should not be encouraged by giving them attention. The Australian Federal Police said in a statement its responsibility was to maintain the safety of parliamentarians and preserve their dignity.

That's why, almost three years after he was elected, the former Wallabies captain found himself at a NSW pub, sharing a beer and a chat with voters, to campaign for a fellow independent running in the National Party's most marginal seat in Australia. Senator Pocock is funding his own trips to support independent candidates like Ms Heise. (ABC Coffs Coast: Claire Simmonds) Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Cowper spans from Coffs Harbour to Port Macquarie on the NSW mid north coast, where Independent Caz Heise is making her second attempt to win the seat which has been held by the National Party and its predecessors for all but three years since 1901. In 2022, she put the seat within a 2.4 per cent margin of sitting Nationals MP, Pat Conaghan. There was standing room only for ""Pocock at the Pub"" in Coffs Harbour. (ABC Coffs Coast: Claire Simmonds) Ms Heise enlisted the help of Senator Pocock in February to talk with her potential constituents at a hotel in Coffs Harbour. A crowd of 250 turned out. The Australian Parliament website lists 13 independents in the lower house and four in the upper house. Independent politicians have long highlighted their separation from a party machine as an important point of difference, but their collaboration is expanding. Just as members of major political party leadership teams visit electorates to support their candidates, independents are doing the same for unelected independent candidates in other electorates. Kylea Tink was applauded on her first speech to parliament by fellow crossbenchers. (Supplied: Parliament of Australia/Mel Adams) After his Coffs Harbour event, Senator Pocock headed to the Gold Coast and launched Erchana Murray-Bartlett's bid for the McPherson electorate. In early March, he travelled to the southern Victorian seat of Wannon to support Alex Dyson in his second attempt at election and and also visited Goldstein sitting member Zoe Daniel in Melbourne. He said he funded the visits himself. Senator Pocock supported the launch of Erchana Murray-Bartlett's campaign for the seat of McPherson. (Supplied: Masao Tamaoki) ""There is a new wave of community-backed independents who have a real shot at winning a seat at the next election,"" Senator Pocock said in a statement. ""After the major parties' stitch-up deal on electoral reform earlier this year, this will be the last election where new independent candidates can compete before the system is skewed even further to the advantage of major parties. ""My focus is on fighting to keep an independent voice in the Senate for the ACT and maximising support for these new candidates so they have the best chance to represent their communities."" Senator Pocock says it's the last election where new independent candidates can compete with major parties. (ABC Coffs Coast: Claire Simmonds) In late 2024 the independent member for North Sydney, Kylea Tink and her Warringah colleague, Zali Steggall, visited southern Queensland seats. ""I thought this was a great opportunity to encourage those communities if they are feeling frustrated, that the alternative is not as hard to imagine or hard to achieve as they might think,"" Ms Steggall said.

""And I've been dependent on her for a bit of advice and encouragement at times."" Monique Ryan, Senator Pocock and Helen Haines collaborate in parliament and outside of Canberra. (Supplied: Monique Ryan) University of Technology Sydney political scientist Mark Riboldi, who has studied independents and minor parties, said collaboration did not make independents a party. ""Climate 200 … have provided elements of party-like coordination and support for these independents, not in the same way that a party does,"" Dr Riboldi said. ""They offer a coordinated funding mechanism through donations to a central place and then they distribute it, they have access to research, polling, marketing, communications that individual candidates wouldn't be able to afford on their own."" Mark Riboldi's research has found ""teal"" independents engage in ""party-like"" behaviour. (Supplied: Jamie James) While so-called ""teal"" independents share information and resources, he said they were not bound by the strict structures of a party in the way Labor, Liberal, Greens or National MPs were.  YouGov polling predicts the independent share of the Australian vote would increase from 5.3 per cent at the last federal election to 8.3 per cent in 2025. It could give the crossbench substantial power if there was a minority government. ""Minority governments have got a long history of stable governments around the world; plenty of Australian states have minority governments,"" Dr Riboldi said. Jacqui Lambie joined Monique Ryan for a town hall forum in Melbourne. (Supplied: Monique Ryan) He said the increase in the independent vote was reflective of voter dissatisfaction. ""Deliberation and negotiation are important democratic principles and that realignment of voters away from major parties potentially indicates voters want more voices in decision making,"" he said. He said the selection of independent candidates backed by Climate 200 varied widely between electorates. Independent hopeful for Southern Victorian seat of Wannon, Alex Dyson attracted the star power of independent MP Helen Haines to a campaign event.

""When it comes to decision making, the people that politicians are accountable to immediately are the ones that they are going to make decisions to benefit. Director of the Australian Studies Institute at the Australian National University, Mark Kenny said there can be both reward and risk with high profile politicians such as David Pocock and Zali Steggall visiting outside their own electorates. Mark Kenny says acting as a party can be a risk for independents. (Supplied: Mark Kenny) ""It is a good way of drawing people in and it's a good way of then enjoying fruits of that, in terms of meeting lots of voters.""  However Professor Kenny said there were risks to connecting with other independents. Professor Kenny points to recent polling showing growing support for the Coalition as a potential threat to both sitting and aspiring independents. ""If there is a genuine distaste for the Labor government, some of those people who were lifelong, habitual Liberal Party supporters, but who voted for community independents last time, may be so annoyed with the government that they want to toss it out.

Albanese willing to direct gas exporters to supply Australia 'if needed',Albanese willing to direct gas exporters to supply Australia 'if needed',2025-03-30 09:34:03,"The prime minister says he would be willing to direct gas companies to secure more supplies for Australia if it is needed, but has downplayed the need for dedicated gas reservation laws as proposed by the Coalition. In his first major interview of the federal election campaign on ABC Insiders, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia already had an effective gas reservation power, which was introduced when his government moved to cap gas and coal prices in 2022. ""We secured six times more gas than what Peter Dutton committed to securing on Thursday night. Peter Dutton opposed the measures we put in place, making the code of conduct mandatory,"" Mr Albanese said. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Last week, Mr Dutton vowed to introduce a scheme to force as much as 20 per cent of gas that would otherwise be sold overseas to be diverted to the Australian market. The Coalition leader said that influx of gas would bring power prices down by the end of the year. Mr Dutton yesterday refused to put a figure on how much he expected consumers would save thanks to more gas in the market, but suggested it could lower the wholesale price from $14 per gigajoule to less than $10 per gigajoule. Coalition senator James Paterson said the party had worked on its policy for more than a year, and would release its modelling soon. ""We won't make the same mistake that Anthony Albanese did before the election when he lied to the Australian people 97 times and told them their electricity bills would go down $275,"" Senator Paterson said. ""Long before the first Australian casts their vote these policies will be in the public domain for people to scrutinise."" Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien told Sky News earlier that the domestic market should be ""decoupled"" from the international market, because Australia was ""awash"" with gas. Experts say the time to establish a gas reservation policy has passed, and plans to bring more gas online are years away and will fail to provide immediate relief to power prices. The gas sector has decried the policy as a ""misfire"" that would be a ""damaging market intervention"" and exacerbate supply challenges in the long term. A gas reservation policy has existed in Western Australia for decades and has been previously endorsed by Labor — but the party has so far held back from supporting the policy in this election. Mr Albanese told Insiders a system was already in place to direct gas giants as a last resort. ""We've actually put in place … a system where we can direct gas companies to secure domestic supply. We put that in place. Peter Dutton voted against it,"" Mr Albanese said. ""Effectively it is [a gas reservation policy]. If it's needed, the government has the power to do that."" What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. Asked whether he would be prepared to do so, Mr Albanese responded: ""Of course, and the law provides that."" Senator Paterson challenged that there was already an effective power to direct the gas giants. ""It is clearly not working, which is why households are paying 30 per cent more,"" he said. ""We will legislate using the Commonwealth's significant legislative power to require that happens.""

Labor pulls ahead in poll that had Dutton in front six weeks ago,YouGov modelling shows swing back to Labor with majority government potentially in reach,2025-03-30 07:55:26,"Labor enters the federal election campaign in a stronger position than it was just six weeks ago, with polling released today suggesting the government could even be returned in majority. Research from pollster YouGov has found that if an election were held today, Labor would end up with a median estimate of 75 seats in the next parliament, with a lower estimate of 69 and an upper estimate of 80. That central estimate is just one short of 76, a majority in parliament. The Coalition is behind on 60, with a lower estimate of 55 and an upper estimate of 68. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail The estimate is the result of the organisation's latest MRP model, in which 38,629 surveys were conducted, with the results modelled across all 150 electorates to produce an estimate of the vote share in each seat. It will not predict every single seat accurately. It is a marked change from YouGov's last MRP model published six weeks ago, which found at that time that the Coalition were the favourite to win the election. Labor is now ahead in 10 of the seats where it was behind in the February modelling. This latest research finds the Coalition would gain six seats: Bennelong, Gilmore, Werriwa and Robertson in NSW, Lyons in Tasmania and the seat of Aston, which it lost in a by-election. Labor would gain Griffith and Brisbane, which are currently held by The Greens. It also suggests Labor could gain Deakin in Victoria from the Liberals, which would be a surprising result. It is just one model and should not be taken as a prediction of the outcome of the election, but it is consistent with other quantitative research that has recorded a tightening in the race in recent weeks. The model suggests there is still significant uncertainty in the election outcome. The surveys were conducted between February 27 and March 26, almost entirely before the federal budget was announced, along with several new policies from the major parties. YouGov estimates a 38 per cent chance of a Labor majority government were an election held today, and a 61 per cent chance of a hung parliament. Nationally, the poll found Labor had 50.2 per cent support in two-party preferred terms, with the Coalition on 49.8 per cent. That would represent a swing back toward Labor of around 1.3 per cent since YouGov's February poll. That result is consistent with the shift recorded toward the government in the past month across the polling industry as a whole. YouGov's director of public data Paul Smith puts at least part of the shift away from the Coalition down to Peter Dutton scoring own goals with ""very unpopular"" policies. ""Dutton needed to win working-class votes in outer suburban Sydney and Melbourne but his Trump-style policies of ending work from home and cutting 40,000 public servants have seen his support dramatically impacted,"" he said. The model now estimates a larger crossbench than was predicted six weeks ago, with a central estimate of 15 seats. It suggests the Greens are ahead in two of its four seats, and incumbent independents are generally performing well. It has independent candidates Alex Dyson ahead in Wannon in regional Victoria, and Caz Heise ahead in Cowper on the NSW mid-north coast, with Nicolette Boele very close to overtaking the Liberals in the Sydney seat of Bradfield. This poll, like YouGov's last MRP, was conducted with a ""generic ballot"", where respondents were asked who they would vote for from a list of parties without being told the names of candidates running in their seat. This is standard practice for many pollsters at this point in the election cycle, where the full list of candidates is unknown, but it introduces considerable uncertainty in predicting the results in seats with strong independent or minor party challenges. In general, MRP models have a better record of accuracy when estimating seat shares for established parties than for independents. MRP models also struggle where there are significant local factors specific to a particular seat. MRP models are a snapshot in time and will not correctly predict the winner in every single seat, but they give us a better idea of geographic trends and patterns in voter behaviour. This model continues to record the largest swings against the government in outer metropolitan seats. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage As well as indicating a general tightening in the contest, the significant shift in the estimates suggests that the outcome of the election is sensitive to small shifts in voter behaviour. There are 14 seats that YouGov predicts are ""toss-ups"" or ""leaning"" towards one party, and there are 24 seats in the model where the leading candidate has less than 52 per cent of the two-candidate-preferred share of the vote. There are a very large number of soft and swing voters right now who could change their minds during the campaign. It demonstrates that the quality of the major parties' campaigns could have a significant impact on how many seats they win. ""Events can shift outcomes very quickly,"" Paul Smith says.

These Victorian seats will be crucial in the upcoming federal election,These are the Victorian seats to watch at the upcoming federal election,2025-04-01 10:28:35,"All roads to the Lodge run through Victoria. The state, once dismissed as the Massachusetts of Australia due to its progressive proclivity, presents a path both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton must tread very carefully. Both sides know that Victoria, in particular Melbourne, is key. Pollsters agree. Parties note that many of the seats are being fought on very different boundaries to the last poll. The ALP, as the incumbent at federal and state level, is battling against a feeling of ""pessimism"" in the community. There are 38 seats up for grabs — one fewer than in 2022, after Higgins was abolished. Labor holds 24 seats, the Liberals seven, their Coalition partners the Nationals three, teal"" independents have two, the Greens one and independent Helen Haines is the MP for Indi. The Liberals come off a low base after voters abandoned it under Scott Morrison, while Labor is suffering from voter disappointment, anger at the state government's performance and general anti-government sentiment after the pandemic hit Victoria the hardest. Even the most optimistic of Labor figures predict the party will lose a couple of seats in Victoria, while on a bad day for the ALP it could lose up to eight. So what seats are the ones to watch? The first three to keep an eye on are seats considered to be most vulnerable for the federal government: Aston, Chisholm and McEwen. Labor made history when it shocked all the experts to win Aston at the 2023 April Fool's Day by-election. It has a 3.6 per cent margin but few believe Labor will hold onto the seat in Melbourne's suburban east, at the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Chisholm is an old-fashioned Labor vs Liberal contest in an established part of Melbourne's east. Labor's Carina Garland holds it by 3.3 per cent and will enjoy strong support from unions in her bid to survive. There's a large Chinese-Australian vote which will be pivotal, as will politics of the Suburban Rail Loop which cuts right through the seat. Katie Allen, who lost Higgins for the Liberals, is the party's candidate. McEwen makes this list every election but has been held by Labor's Rob Mitchell since 2013. At every poll, the Liberals have talked up their chances, but with a 3.8 per cent margin, 2025 could shape as the best chance in a seat that includes new growth suburbs and regional communities. The Coalition will be pinning its hopes on the fuel excise discount as a vote winner in a seat where car is king. The next batch of seats Labor is working tooth and nail to sandbag includes electorates once thought of as safe seats. In Melbourne's south-east, centred on Frankston, is Dunkley, a seat Labor has held since 2019. Labor retained the electorate after Peta Murphy died in late 2023, with a margin of 2.7 per cent. Labor campaigners are feeling okay about the seat and the Liberals aren't talking their chances up, but always one to watch. David Speers presents Australia's must-watch political program, joined by a panel of the best political analysts and commentators. Stream now on ABC iview. If someone told you that Bruce — with a 5.3 per cent margin — would be a seat to watch three years ago, you'd probably have laughed. But right now, the seat in Labor heartland is causing headaches. It's one of several once-safe seats now swinging against the status quo due to cost of living and dissatisfaction with major parties. Labor’s Julian Hill is still odds-on to hold, but he faces a tough fight in Melbourne’s south-east. On a bad day for Labor, Hawke, in Melbourne's exploding outer north-west, could fall due to a continuing trend of Labor shedding votes in safe areas. The seat, which includes Melton, was savaged by the pandemic and could suffer from the Labor ""takes us for granted'' sentiment that is creeping in Melbourne north and west. Opinion is divided within each major party over whether perennial swing seat, Corangamite, which takes in Geelong's suburbs, the Bellarine, Colac and Torquay, is up for grabs. The seat — currently held by Labor — is always a seat keeping an eye on. Labor's pain is not confined to its old enemy. On its ideological left, the Greens pose major challenges in Wills in Melbourne's inner-north and Macnamara on the other side of the Yarra River, where a three-way race with the Liberals make it a hard seat to call. The politics of the Israel-Gaza War is overt in these contests, especially in Wills where the Greens are hoping to capitalise on affluent progressives in the south of the electorate and large Muslim populations in the north. Aside from Labor's victory, the rise of the teal independents was the big story of the 2022 election. In Melbourne, Monique Ryan vanquished then-treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong, a seat once consider a jewel in the crown of the Liberal Party and once held by long-serving PM Robert Menzies. The leafy, affluent seat is again one to watch with another member of Liberal royalty, Amelia Hamer, trying to unseat Dr Ryan. The independent incumbent grabbed headlines last week for all the wrong reasons, when her husband was caught removing a sign for Ms Hamer. By the bay, it's a rematch between former ABC-correspondent-turned-MP Zoe Daniel and the man she beat three years ago, Tim Wilson in Goldstein. Both contests are tipped to be tight. And don't forget Wannon. The seat in Victoria's vast Western District is an unconventional contest between established Liberal frontbencher Dan Tehan and former triple-j host and comedian Alex Dyson, who is making his third run at the seat. This time, his campaign is well resourced and growing in popularity. But the margin is only 3.8 per cent. It's a diverse electorate of farming communities, regional centres and popular coastal towns.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese set the tone for his day when, feet planted beneath a Hills Hoist, he told reporters that price gouging was ""when supermarkets are taking the piss [out of] Australian consumers"". He then sat down at the kitchen table with a single mother (and her mother, and Labor MP Alicia Payne) and discussed the cost of groceries. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's day on the hustings had a decidedly multicultural flavour to it, encompassing a visit to a brickworks, an Assyrian New Year festival and a mosque across three different Western Sydney electorates. Take a look back at how the day unfolded with our live blog below. By Andrew Thorpe It's time to wrap up our live blog for the day — thanks for joining us on this second full day of the 2025 campaign.

Of course, we've also got more stories in the pipeline going live tonight and tomorrow morning — but in the meantime, why not check out the rest of today's online coverage at our Australia Votes page? There are 34 more days until election day. We'll see you tomorrow. By Andrew Thorpe The opposition leader is continuing his tour of Western Sydney, arriving at the Al-Mariah Masjid mosque in Leppington, in the Labor-held seat of Macarthur. He promises $25,000 to boost security at the mosque, in the form of a grant for CCTV cameras. A West Australian teenager was earlier this month charged with making online threats against the Al-Bayt Al-Islami mosque in nearby Edmondson Park. By Tom Crowley Australia's migration surge is receding faster than it grew, with the total number of temporary residents well on its way to pre-pandemic levels even as migration shapes as a prominent election issue. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has seized on the record levels of net migration over the last two years, accusing Labor of a ""Big Australia policy"" that has exacerbated the housing crisis. ""Labor's brought in a million people over two years through the migration program, which is a record for our country,"" Mr Dutton said on Friday. ""Now, all of those people need homes to live in, and that's why Australians have found it really hard to find a house, to either buy a house or rent a house, under Mr Albanese."" Economists including the Grattan Institute's Brendan Coates have supported the view that the increase in temporary migration added to existing pressure in the housing market, particularly the rental market. But official figures show the numbers are now falling at a rate of 100,000 people per year since peaking at 536,000 in 2022-23. That rate is enough for a swift return to pre-pandemic levels.

By Andrew Thorpe We've spoken a lot about price gouging in the blog today, but it's been tricky to nail down the details — mostly because the government's proposal doesn't contain too many of them. Not content to let that stop him, political reporter Tom Crowley has taken a look at the broader issue of price gouging — what it is, what the current rules and regulations are, and what outlawing the practice might look like. You can have a read of the piece below: By Victorian state political reporter Richard Willingham All roads to the Lodge run through Victoria. The state, once dismissed as the Massachusetts of Australia due to its progressive proclivity, presents a path both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton must tread very carefully. Both sides know that Victoria is key. Pollsters agree. So which seats are the ones to watch? You can learn more via the link below. By Andrew Thorpe The PM's announcement of $2 million in aid for Myanmar after the earthquake comes after more than 70 Myanmarese diaspora groups in Australia last night signed an open letter calling on the government to play a leading role in providing support to the Myanmarese people. The letter highlights that the epicentre of the earthquake was in a part of the country primarily under the control of anti-junta rebels, and that the Myanmar military has continued its operations — including air strikes — in affected areas even as the rescue effort continues. ""Over 3 million people in Myanmar are internally displaced, and half the population is living below the poverty line,"" the letter reads. ""This situation will be severely compounded by the earthquake. ""The international community has made efforts to provide aid to Myanmar since the coup, but these efforts have been insufficient to meet the scale of the crisis primarily because the military junta controls and obstructs the delivery of aid to areas where resistance groups are active; and international funding for Myanmar has been insufficient."" By Elissa Steedman The federal government has released some more details on the $2 million in aid approved for Myanmar. Australia will provide the funds through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for immediate relief following Friday's earthquake. More than 1,644 people have been confirmed dead, according to state media. At least 3,400 people have been injured and 139 are missing. Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong  and Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said in a joint statement that Australia's support would assist the ICRC in carrying out immediate lifesaving support. ""Australia also welcomes the release of US$5 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support urgent needs such as shelter, food and water. Australia is a longstanding donor to the CERF,"" the statement reads. ""The ongoing crisis in Myanmar is a major threat to stability in our region. Australia continues to provide support in response to the worsening humanitarian situation. ""Australia does not provide any direct funding to the military regime and takes proactive steps to ensure our assistance does not legitimise the military regime in Myanmar."" By Fiona Willan Peter Dutton danced his way into the Assyrian New Year's festival we mentioned earlier — and he was greeted by a troupe of traditional performers. Something that made the colourful entrance appear even more unusual? The fact the opposition leader was doing it alongside Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen, shortly after campaigning in the Labor frontbencher's seat of McMahon. The pair are both attending the festival as guests of honour, along with independent MP Dai Le, who holds the seat of Fowler where the festival is taking place. It's no surprise the Liberal leader took his campaign to Sydney's west so quickly — the Coalition believes it has a path to victory through the outer suburban electorates of Sydney. By Stephanie Dalzell Never one to shy away from a good pun, Greens leader Adam Bandt has declared that Labor's ""gone shopping in the policy supermarket"" and taken home the Greens' plan to make price gouging illegal. The government has vowed to outlaw the practice if it's returned to power on May 3, saying it would establish a taskforce to crack down on supermarkets doing the wrong thing. The consumer watchdog recently found Coles and Woolworths were among the most profitable supermarket chains in the world, but was unable to conclusively say whether the companies were actively price gouging. Late last year, the Greens sought to introduce a bill to parliament to outlaw excessive price hikes, and declared it would be a priority for the party in the next parliament. Adam Bandt says Labor 'went shopping' for policy from Greens Speaking from the Labor-held seat of Macnamara in Victoria — a seat the Greens are targeting — Adam Bandt attributed the government's announcement to his party's pressure and persistence. ""Labor has picked up the Greens' policy to make supermarket price gouging illegal, and that's great news for Australian shoppers,"" Bandt said. ""Labor copying the Greens homework — you love to see it! Greens pressure works. ""The prime minister has gone shopping in the policy supermarket and picked up the Greens' plan to make supermarket price gouging illegal. ""That's a great deal for Australian shoppers, and while he's there he could also put in the trolley the Greens' plan to get dental into Medicare and to cap rent increases as well."" By Andrew Thorpe Education Minister Jason Clare appeared on Sky News earlier today, telling political editor Andrew Clennell schools have a role to play in teaching boys how to behave appropriately towards women. Clare said any father who read the story in this morning's Sunday Telegraph about misogynistic TikTok accounts being run by Sydney school students would be ""disgusted"". ""That's why we're rolling out $70 million in consent and respectful relationships education for boys when they're young,"" he said. ""But it's not just what happens at school. We've got roles as dads here to make sure that we raise our boys properly. ""When we hear our mates talk about women in the wrong way at the pub or in general conversation, we've got to call that out as well. ""If they're seeing the sort of crap that Andrew Tate and people like that talk about, then that sort of toxic cesspit can affect our kids."" Asked whether he had seen the Netflix series Adolescence, which focuses on the way young men can be radicalised by figures such as Tate, Clare said he was talking to his wife about it last night. ""It's terrifying. It's terrifying,"" he said. By Elissa Steedman  Peter Dutton and his press pack have now arrived at an Assyrian New Year's celebration in Fairfield, Sydney. My colleague Fiona Willan says the opposition leader and his Western Sydney candidates have been greeted by traditional dancers. ""In a plot twist, they're walking alongside Energy Minister Chris Bowen,"" she tells us. Independent MP for Fowler Dai Le is also at the event. By Fiona Willan At times the press conference was drowned out by factory noise, but the message was clear — Peter Dutton was pitching his gas policy to voters in this region, where some are experiencing the highest rates of household financial stress in the country. Dutton claims his policy will lower power bills, but has refused to say by how much. The brickworks factory in Horsley Park where this press conference was being held also happened to be in Chris Bowen's electorate. The energy minister's seat isn't considered to be in play, but a handful of other Labor-held seats in Western Sydney are. Security was also much tighter today after protesters gatecrashed two of his events yesterday. I arrived late and was asked to wait in the front lobby until my identity was verified (presumably because a number of Rising Tide protesters have been posing as journalists to infiltrate recent events). By Andrew Thorpe Pressed once again to provide a dollar figure for how much the Coalition expects its gas plan to save households on power bills, Dutton says ""you'll see some more analysis come out over the next couple of days"" which will provide ""some percentage figures"". That's a more specific commitment than we've heard previously, with the opposition leader preferring to reassure journalists that ""others"" will have plenty to say about the policy's effects. Dutton closes out the press conference shortly afterwards. By Andrew Thorpe Peter Dutton describes PM as 'weak as water' The opposition leader's already called Anthony Albanese ""weak"" twice during this press conference, and now he's used the term to describe the PM's approach to outlawing price gouging. Asked to respond to Albanese's definition of the practice as ""when supermarkets are taking the piss"", Dutton employs what can only be described as a pregnant pause. ""I would say that the prime minister is as weak as … water. I really would,"" he says. It's worth recalling the opposition's preferred approach to tackling rising supermarket prices is enforced divestiture — a proposal the government took great relish in likening to something out of the Soviet Union. Both of these leaders seem to enjoy flipping the script. By Tom Crowley It's hard to keep up with the number of referendums raised in this Peter Dutton press conference. On Indigenous constitutional recognition, Dutton says (paraphrasing): There's a case for it, but Labor doesn't want to so I doubt it will happen. On four-year parliamentary terms, Dutton says: I'm open to it, but Labor doesn't want to so I doubt it will happen. On cancelling the citizenships of dual citizens, he repeats: a Dutton government would try legislative options but consider a referendum as a last resort. That's three referendums — none of them actually planned for the next term, but none of them ruled out, either. It's probably not what he was hoping to talk about on his trip to a brickworks in Western Sydney, where the cost of doing business was his intended focus. That's especially true given the amount of time he has spent accusing Anthony Albanese of being distracted from the cost of living by the Voice referendum of 2023. But election campaigns with a travelling press pack can be like that, and when a politician doesn't squash an issue immediately, there's a good chance it will keep cropping up. By Andrew Thorpe The opposition leader is asked about his previous support for a referendum on recognising Indigenous people in Australia's constitution — a position he first floated while justifying his opposition to the Voice to Parliament. Dutton makes it clear he prefers to talk about ""practical support"" for Indigenous Australians, and pursuing constitutional recognition won't be a priority for the Coalition. ""There will be no referendum until there's a position of bipartisanship, and clearly there's no bipartisanship on this issue,"" he says. ""So there will be no referendum over the course of the next term of parliament, the prime minister's made that very clear."" By Andrew Thorpe Peter Dutton is tying in energy prices to a range of different policy areas now, talking about how they affect employment, construction costs, infrastructure and the everyday cost of living. He also makes the point that the Coalition has moved forward with energy policy proposals both sides of politics have avoided for years. ""People have spoken for years and years about an east coast gas reservation — we've put the policy on the table,"" he says. It's similar to the case he's previously made for his nuclear policy — short on modelling and derided by experts, but tapping into a populist vein in the electorate that favours bold action over tinkering around the edges while power prices rise. By Andrew Thorpe Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is finally up now, speaking to the media from an Austral brickworks in Western Sydney. He begins with a familiar pitch on energy prices. ""The prime minister can't afford to keep giving out the $150 cheques, because people's power bills have been going up by $1,300,"" he says. ""This election is a test of who do you trust to manage the economy so that we can deal with cost-of-living pressures."" By Elissa Steedman The Coalition has promised it will increase personal income taxes for all Australians if elected. It's a move Treasurer Jim Chalmers says has ""never happened before in our country"". ""They will legislate to increase taxes at the same time that they won't come clean on their secret costs and their secret cuts,"" he says.  ""They will make Australians worse off as a consequence."" Chalmers accuses the Coalition of committing to higher taxes and other cost-cutting measures as a way to pay for its nuclear power plan. ""They need to find $600 billion from somewhere, and they can't find that $600 billion for nuclear reactors without coming after Medicare again, like they did last time.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-30/federal-election-2025-campaign-trail-day-3-blog/105113462
'Won't back down': Inside the anti-wind farm crusade threatening Labor seats,The offshore wind debate could influence this federal election and it's already an 'absolute blood-fest',2025-03-30 06:24:32,"The Illawarra, on the NSW south coast, can be hostile territory for Australian politicians. In 1939, Robert Menzies was booed by thousands of placard-waving locals as police escorted him down the Bulli Pass to meet striking waterside workers in Wollongong. It was here that the man who became Australia's longest-serving prime minister acquired the nickname ""Pig Iron Bob"" after he opposed the wharfies who refused to load pig iron on a ship bound for Japan for fear it would be used for military purposes. Fast forward to 2025 and it was Anthony Albanese's turn to feel the heat down near the steelworks. During a February press conference announcing his new candidate for Whitlam, he copped a gobful from a man dressed in a tan shirt and black shorts. ""Get out of our town, Albo!"" the man yelled. ""We don't want your wind farms!"" That protester was financial adviser Alex O'Brien, who is not just another local resident. Alex O'Brien received national attention after heckling Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in February. (Supplied) Mr O'Brien is, in fact, president of a not-for-profit association called Responsible Future (Illawarra Chapter) or RFI, whose purpose is to tank Labor's proposed offshore wind project in the Illawarra. The 36-year-old's on-camera heckling of the prime minister made it onto big TV news bulletins and would've been the first time many Australians had seen or heard of him. But behind the scenes, Mr O'Brien's influence has been growing, as the community activist has met with senior Liberals such as Peter Dutton and been invited to speak at Parliament House by Coalition senators involved in the inquiry into the offshore wind consultation process. RFI's many objections to offshore wind farms have increasingly been given a platform in local, national, and even international media. But many are questioning whether the messaging pushed by the group and its associated social media accounts has been distorting and poisoning the debate. Peter Dutton in Busselton last year announcing he would axe the WA offshore wind project if elected. (ABC South West: Bridget McArthur) RFI has been accused of ""Trumpian-style"" attacks on advocates and experts, spreading misinformation and disinformation narratives imported from the US, misrepresenting the true level of community opposition for the project and cherrypicking the testimony of a prominent conservation group. RFI's rhetoric has been amplified by the Coalition, which hopes anti-wind farm sentiment can help them pick up seats such as Gilmore and Whitlam on the south coast and Paterson in the Hunter. Mr Dutton has vowed to scrap three of Labor's offshore wind farm projects, including in the Illawarra, if elected. Offshore wind farm projects have seen resistance across the globe. (Supplied: Southerly Ten) While there are many legitimate questions about what impact any potential wind farm could have on the environment and industry, the debate in the Illawarra has turned toxic at times. Even the veteran leader of the South Coast Labour Council, Arthur Rorris, a man used to the rough and tumble of union politics, has been shocked by what he's seen. ""People have been bombarded with combinations of conspiracy theories, wild accusations, and what ended up being an absolute blood-fest when they started attacking individuals and their reputations,"" he said. Formed in January 2024, RFI evolved out of three local Facebook groups and has since become a key force driving opposition to the offshore wind project. However, the group's ambitions aren't limited to the NSW south coast. ""This fight isn't just about Illawarra,"" Mr O'Brien said in March. ""It's about every regional community being steamrolled by flawed renewable projects. Canberra needs to listen, and we won't back down until they do."" The group won't disclose its membership figures but claims it has more than 1,200 registered ongoing supporters and volunteers — as a recently formed association, it is not required to lodge its first financial records until July this year. Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. No offshore wind farms have been approved yet in the Illawarra. It hasn't even got to a stage where a feasibility licence has been issued, but RFI has already objected to the project on virtually every ground imaginable. It's argued it will cost too much; drive up power prices; not produce enough power; be owned by a foreign multinational; spoil the view; ruin commercial fishing; kill whales; threaten bird and marine life; cost jobs in tourism and hospitality; reduce water quality, and; would rely on experimental technology. In doing so, the group has been accused of spreading misinformation. In one notable example, Mr O'Brien falsely accused the government of paying for the mapping of the seabed off the coast of the Illawarra on behalf of a developer who hadn't even been issued a licence to develop a wind farm. In January, Alex O'Brien posted about ""secret"" seabed surveys, suggesting they harmed endangered marine life. (Facebook/ABC News graphic) In January, Mr O'Brien claimed in Facebook posts and in a TV interview that taxpayers were ""footing the bill for millions in seabed surveys conducted in secret over Christmas in the Illawarra offshore wind zone"". He questioned why these surveys were happening before feasibility licenses were issued, and then suggested, without evidence, that they could be behind the disappearance of grey nurse sharks. However, these surveys were completely unrelated to offshore wind. The Department of Defence confirmed to the ABC that it ""was conducting an offshore hydrographic survey"" as part of its responsibility to maintain navigation routes for vessels. Keep up with all the major commitments promised by Labor and the Coalition as they campaign for Australia's vote. RFI did not respond to ABC questions about whether it had corrected the record or believed it had spread a conspiracy theory. The anti-wind farm activists have also been accused of engaging in smear campaigns against experts. One of its targets has been Professor Ty Christopher from the University of Wollongong (UOW), who has had a 40-year career in the electricity supply industry, including as a chief engineer at Endeavour Energy. ""There's been a lot of misrepresentation of facts, selective interpretation of facts,"" he said about the debate in the Illawarra. Professor Ty Christopher's credibility was questioned by RFI. (ABC News: Sissy Reyes) Professor Christopher said he, his colleagues at the university and other experts, including at the CSIRO, had all had their integrity attacked after sharing their expertise. Questions around experts' credibility have been constant in anti-wind farm Facebook groups, two of which Mr O'Brien is involved in heavily as either an administrator or ""group expert"". The ABC has seen unfounded claims circulating in the groups that UOW academics had accepted bribes or colluded with private corporations. ""It's been challenging for many of my colleagues on a very deep and personal level to have their professional integrity challenged and frankly, to be challenged by people who were really not offering any rational debate or alternative into the discussion,"" Professor Chrisotpher said. Comments posted in RFI-linked Facebook groups taking aim at UOW and its academics. (ABC News graphic) In early March, Mr O'Brien and RFI vice-president Amanda De Lore travelled to Canberra to give evidence at a meeting held by Coalition senators Ross Cadell and Leah Blyth. It was not a sanctioned hearing of the inquiry that both senators were a part of, but they used it to ask questions of the RFI committee members for a 25-minute period and live-streamed it. When Senator Cadell asked Mr O'Brien about a town hall forum that was part of the consultation process, where Professor Christopher appeared as an energy expert, the RFI president accused him of a conflict of interest. ""He was there representing the University of Wollongong, who had lost $90 million in the 2023 [sic 2020] financial year. And you know, [he] potentially [sees] this project as helping maybe resolve some of those issues."" Professor Christopher refutes these claims. He said he and his colleagues operate ""very much without fear or favour, and without being beholden to anything other than the truth or the facts"" of their research. Coalition senators Ross Cadell and Leah Blyth (centre front) with anti-wind farm activists, including RFI's Alex O'Brien and Amanda De Lore (right). (Facebook: Ross Cadell) The ABC asked Senator Cadell if he agreed with Mr O'Brien's assessment of Professor Christopher and why he didn't challenge him about it at the time. ""The topic of offshore wind in the Illawarra is a divisive matter that deserves thorough questioning on both sides of the debate,"" he said in a statement. ""I will not be forming an opinion until I have heard from all sides of the debate — something Labor and The Greens don't appear interested in."" No system is 100 per cent secure, but ProtonMail can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions to work out the best method of communication for you. South Coast Labour Council's Arthur Rorris, who also appeared on the town hall panels, said he was appalled by the personal attacks on academics. ""What we saw here was a deliberate strategy to take them out so that there wouldn't be any science and evidence,"" he said. ""That's Trumpism. Take out your opponents. Publicly humiliate them, try and cut them down in the hope that others who are watching this won't come forward."" Arthur Rorris accused anti-wind farm activists of ""Trumpian-style"" politics and personal attacks. (ABC News: Sissy Reyes) Mr Rorris said the Labour Council supported offshore wind farms under certain conditions — if they don't harm the environment, if they earn a social licence to operate, and if the community gets economic benefits from the project. ""We have the steelworks, we have coal mines, we have ports. We understand the pressures that we're under to try and decarbonise,"" he said. ""We have seen first-hand what happens if you don't. We survived the black summer fires on the south coast."" This qualified support, however, has led to him being the target of what he called ""very wild and crazy allegations"" on anti-wind farm Facebook groups linked to RFI. ""I started getting phone calls from friends and from associates saying they're accusing you of being corrupt … and of being a shareholder in multinational corporations, that I would personally benefit from all of these things,"" he said. Offshore wind faces community and political opposition as well support for its promise of ample renewable energy and while some claims can be ruled out, experts say other concerns are valid. RFI did not respond to ABC questions about personal attacks made by its members. A spokesperson said its members have been victims of smears. ""We have borne the brunt of wild accusations since the announcement of the proposal, merely for asking authentic questions based on troubling concerns about the potential negative impact of this project,"" the spokesperson said. Much of the anti-offshore wind farm rhetoric in Australia around marine life mirrors arguments that have originated in the US. Most prominent, and arguably effective, are claims the projects are catastrophic to whales and their migration corridors. Facebook groups administered by RFI members are littered with AI-generated or photoshopped images of whales dead among wind turbines and infographics about the project that suggest it could lead to their slow, painful demise. Examples of either AI-generated or photoshopped images of dead whales and marine life posted to anti-wind farm Facebook groups. (Facebook/ABC News graphic) RFI's leadership has admitted to corresponding with American groups that have been fighting similar projects, by highlighting the risk to whales, though RFI did not disclose the name of its US contacts when asked by the ABC. This narrative emerged in 2023 after several whale carcasses were found washed up or floating near New York and New Jersey. Former Fox News host and conspiracy theory peddler Tucker Carlson pointed the finger at offshore wind, calling it the ""DDT of our times"" — a reference to an insecticide that was banned for health and environmental reasons. Several whales were found on New Jersey shores in 2023. (Reuters: Rachel Wisniewski) Donald Trump further amplified this sentiment in September 2023. ""Windmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before. No one does anything about that,"" he said. Expert and US governmental agencies have dismissed these theories. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) said there was no evidence to conclude whale mortality was attributable to offshore wind-related activities. Environmentalists say whales could go deaf during seismic surveys for offshore oil and gas. The reality is more complicated. Research showed the overwhelming number of whale deaths were caused by vessel strikes or entanglement with fishing gear. However, that has not stopped Alex O'Brien from pushing the narrative that wind farms kill whales. In a YouTube interview last year, he stated that people in the US he'd been in contact with had noticed "" a significant increase in whale mortality"" around offshore wind projects. RFI, in its response to the ABC, maintained there was a ""concerning rise of marine mortality events near offshore wind developments"" off the United Kingdom and New Jersey coastlines. ""This issue remains under-researched but should not be ignored,"" the spokesperson said. RFI also cited the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd Australia (SSA) in defence of its statements about threats wind farms posed to marine life. However, in its submission to a Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) consultation process about the Illawarra project, Sea Shepherd Australia said its views had been misrepresented by anti-wind farm proponents. ""SSA is concerned about the explosion of misinformation and disinformation around the OSW (Offshore Wind) industry,"" it said. Sea Shepherd confirmed to the ABC that the group in question was RFI. The conservation group agreed that questions about the environmental impact of wind farms were valid, and noted in its submission to the DCCEEW these would be addressed in detail when the feasibility licence holder was decided and had to undertake environmental impact assessments. As there has yet to be an approval process, a vacuum has opened up for misinformation and disinformation about a project that has yet to be properly outlined. The map of the declared area for offshore renewable energy as of June 15, 2024. (Supplied: DCCEEW) US company BlueFloat Energy applied for a seven-year feasibility licence to explore the viability of the project, but last month asked the government to pause its application until after the May 3 election in light of Coalition threats to kill off the project. That feasibility process would've included scientific studies to assess the best location, size, and arrangement of wind turbines, as well as environmental approvals and further community consultation. Allegations of misinformation and disinformation have also been directed at RFI over claims it has been making about what it says is widespread opposition in the community to offshore wind farms. During the initial consultation process, 14,200 submissions were made through the DCCEEW website. Of these, 65 per cent of respondents said they opposed the project. Mr O'Brien has used that figure out of context to suggest it accurately represents the scale of opposition to the project across the community. The RFI president has said 65 per cent of the local community had ""voted against"" the project despite there being no plebiscite on the matter. On Sky News, he made similar comments, stating that ""65 per cent of the community down here said no to the offshore wind project"". Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Liberal candidate for the neighbouring seat of Cunningham Amanda Ivaneza has also publicly declared ""65 per cent of the community opposed the project"". Not mentioned is that over a quarter of the submissions made to the DCCEEW came from outside the Illawarra and that there are serious concerns raised in the official departmental analysis of these submissions about whether the consultation process was gamed by anti-wind farm activists. The DCCEEW said it was aware of people making submissions using non-valid email addresses or had made multiple submissions. It estimated that around 9 per cent, or about 1,225 submissions, were either duplicates or false. There are also accusations that anti-wind farm activists had encouraged fake submissions. Martin Cubby, a member of the Greens and the pro-offshore wind group Good for the Gong, signed a statutory declaration that he witnessed this during a 2023 community meeting held by opponents of the project. Cunningham MP Alison Byrnes said an offer for RFI to meet with the climate and energy minister was declined. (Twitter: Elliot Stein) The declaration was witnessed by a staffer of local Labor MP Alison Byrnes, who then read it in parliament, describing it as ""a coordinated effort to undermine and inflate representations of community options to this parliament and to the government"". ""Mr Cubby put to me that at a community meeting on 28 September this year, members of the Coalition Against Offshore Wind, 'encouraged community members to submit multiple submissions to the REZ (Renewable Energy Zone) through the federal government website using alternative or fake email addresses,"" Ms Byrnes said. A former representative of the Coalition Against Offshore Wind who was at the meeting denied Mr Cubby's versions of events. During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help. RFI told the ABC that it heard that during community sessions run in 2023, DCCEEW representatives had advised residents that they could submit multiple responses. ""For example, some people may have focused strongly on environmental matters in one submission and may have wished to add legitimate concerns about other elements in another submission,"" the RFI spokesperson said. ""We are not in a position to explain why the department would permit fake emails, if this did occur."" The DCCEEW said it also found evidence of the promotion of artificial intelligence (AI) software to generate responses as well as financial inducements being offered for negative submissions. In a since-deleted Facebook post, a local woman offered beauty services in exchange for negative consultation submissions. (Facebook/ABC News graphic) A local beautician posted in a local anti-wind farm Facebook group and offered up to $1,400 worth of services for people to make negative submissions. The woman described proponents of the project as ""corrupt"". She told the ABC she was just an ""ordinary citizen"" and that no one had taken her up on the offer, which she made because she believed the project would ""destroy the ocean"". RFI has been explicit about its support for candidates who have vowed to scrap the project. Mr O'Brien was photographed with opposition leader Peter Dutton and Liberal candidate for Gilmore Andrew Constance last December — RFI said it was ""grateful"" to them for listening to community concerns. RFI president Mr O'Brien, Liberal leader Mr Dutton and Liberal candidate for Gilmore Andrew Constance in December. (Supplied: Responsible Future) RFI has accused the federal government of ignoring community concerns and said the project consultation was launched by Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen with a predetermined outcome. Labor disputes this. It says there have been six consultation sessions and other meetings with stakeholder groups, in addition to the two town hall forums. Further consultation was planned if a feasibility licence was awarded. At Parliament House in March, RFI vice-president Amanda De Lore said: ""We've never really sat down at the table with anyone in … the federal Labor government, that really were interested in answering any of our questions."" RFI told the ABC that Ms Byrnes and politicians on both sides have been invited to its community information evenings and rallies but ""no-one from the state or federal Labor party attended"". Responsible Future's Alex O'Brien and Amanda De Lore at an unofficial hearing in Parliament House this month. (Facebook: Senator Ross Cadell) However, Ms Byrnes disputed suggestions the ALP had ignored the group. Her office showed the ABC an email to RFI last July offering to set up a meeting with Mr Bowen. RFI declined the offer. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, a member of a Senate committee looking into the offshore wind industry consultation process, said he had questions about who was backing RFI. ""The Senate received very troubling information through the inquiry's submissions process that key Australian groups opposing offshore wind rollouts are not in fact the grassroots community movements they claim to be,"" he said. ""Rather, they are linked to political, organised and well-funded global campaigns to undermine renewable energy."" What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. Senator Whish-Wilson said he would have invited Mr O'Brien to give evidence if the committee had not been halted before the election. ""I would have liked to have heard his concerns, and the Greens would have taken the opportunity to cross-examine him on any connection he or his group may have to political parties, organised astroturfing strategies and other shady global think tank structures."" The RFI denied being funded by third-party groups. ""We have no funding from fossil fuel groups, special interests, or foreign entities. It is laughable to suggest we are part of a conspiracy,"" a spokesperson said. ""Any suggestion otherwise is false and defamatory. We are happy to sign a statement confirming this. Will offshore wind proponents and their associated groups do the same?"" The group told the ABC its members bring with them ""a whole range of political backgrounds and views"". Nationals candidate Katrina Hodgkinson described the upcoming election in Whitlam as ""almost a referendum here on wind turbines"". (ABC News: Sissy Reyes) If the Coalition forms government, the project will be scrapped. If Labor wins, the feasibility licence process will be reopened. The Nationals, in a recent visit to the Illawarra, described the upcoming election as ""almost a referendum here on wind turbines"". Leader David Littleproud believed the community does not want offshore wind farms. ""That's the beautiful thing called democracy,"" he said. ""Every three years, you get to put us in or chuck us out … you talk about whether the community supports it? We'll see in about six weeks' time."" Additional reporting by Michael Workman.

"Dutton asked reporters a question of his own, but it might come back to bite",Early confidence may just be hubris as Peter Dutton gets hooked on gas,2025-03-30 08:45:35,"For a politician, Peter Dutton did something rare. He stopped talking. Breaking the old radio rule that silence is deadly, the opposition leader went full Harold Pinter, elongating at yesterday's press conference a pause so thick the soupy Brisbane air looked like it was about to swallow him up. Flipping the usual order of the universe, it began after Dutton asked reporters his own question. ""You're all experts in this space … does anyone believe that Anthony Albanese can form a majority government after the election?"" Looking to his right, then slowly panning left, his gaze traversed the gathered pack as the seconds piled up. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail One Mississippi… two Mississippi… three Mississippi… It got to almost 6 seconds before Dutton broke. Further weirdness averted. ""There's not one political expert in the country that is predicting that Mr Albanese can form a majority government after the election,"" he declared. It was one of those moments, on day one of the campaign, that might come back to bite. Of course, Dutton could be right. It's not a bold bet, after all. Albanese, with a slender three-seat majority, doesn't need to lose much to become a loser. Minority government is very much on the cards. But let Dutton's point sink in a bit. Peter Dutton makes energy policy a point of difference in campaign. (Greg Jennett) It comes so early in a contest, we're told, that is all about swaying an unusually large number of undecided voters. The claim that Albanese cannot win in his own right has more than just a whiff of arrogance. Yes, the polls have been bad for Albanese for some time. But voters have a habit of confounding predictions. Nothing stays static for long in this business. It might just pay to keep an open mind. Indeed today, the ABC's Casey Briggs has exclusive polling showing Labor is ahead in 10 seats where it was behind six weeks ago. YouGov suggests Labor could end up with a median estimate of 75 seats in parliament — achingly close to that majority Dutton suggests is impossible. You'd be a fool to take any single poll as anything more than a snapshot in time. Yet there is a sense the political ground is shifting. Dutton's simple question to voters — are you better off? — could hurt Labor and Albanese in suburban swing seats. Particularly in Victoria and NSW, where the big gains and losses are to be had. But the opposition leader is facing full scrutiny of his own plans, some of which lack key details. Nowhere is this more apparent than Dutton's captain's pick gas policy reservation promise, announced as the cornerstone of Thursday's budget reply speech. Not only is the plan complicated to explain to voters — it's not immediately clear what the wholesale price of a gigajoule of gas has to do with your energy bill — the idea has landed with a thud, leaving the gas industry shocked and feeling betrayed. A leading gas expert and strident Labor critic has suggested the Coalition's policy could lead to less gas. The simple notion that Dutton will keep ""more gas for Australians"" has superficial political appeal. No doubt there would have been a temptation in Dutton's mind to go even further. As it now stands, he is promising to force gas giants to divert up to 20 per cent of ""uncontracted"" gas from the export market to domestic users. Dutton says that will push the price of gas from $14 a gigajoule to $10 a gigajoule. Modelling has been done by the same firm that did his nuclear plan, with the opposition leader promising it will be released ""very soon"". But the danger with his plan — announced via half a dozen paragraphs in his speech without an accompanying press release or even basic fact sheet — is that it relies on the economically dubious notion that an oversupplied market (for anything, quite frankly) will stay oversupplied, thereby ""flooding"" domestic users with cheap gas. Industry figures — whom one close player described as being on the ""brink of apoplexy"" — say Dutton's reservation will ultimately result in less gas coming to market. The first thing the gas producers will do is curb spending on new supply. The $10 per gigajoule level will become a cap. Dutton enters this election campaign with natural advantages. One of them is the Coalition's reputation in the minds of voters as a strong economic manager. But by adopting an idea favoured by some on the political left and manufacturing unions, Dutton's gas reservation risks eroding that reputation. Critics point to the danger it poses to Australia's status as a reliable regional trade partner among key allies, including Japan and South Korea. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Finalised in the hours before his speech, the policy has also exposed the industry's advocates to the harsh realities of raw campaign politics. Some gas players have been quietly working with the Coalition over recent months to develop a package they believed would suit their needs, with things like faster environmental approvals, curbs on the ability of climate activists to engage in ""lawfare"" appeals, and defunding the Environmental Defenders Office. In exchange for those benefits, which Dutton reiterated on Thursday, the Coalition told them the quid pro quo would be a domestic reservation on ""prospective"" or future offshore gas projects. To their horror on Thursday night, they learned that Dutton went further than they could have imagined, imposing a gas reservation scheme that is retrospective. As in, it targets the output of hundreds of billions of dollars of existing project investments. When the price cap and reservation saps incentives to invest in additional supply, the gas that is contracted for export will be the next target, predicts energy analyst Saul Kavonic. Labor sources have noted privately that the industry's lobby group, Australian Energy Producers, has been quick to slam the government over Resources Minister Madeleine King's planned ""whole of system"" gas review. ""This is the opportunity for the gas industry to shape the future of the regulation of the market — and AEP bag it whenever they get the chance,"" said one source. ""And now this from their 'friends'."" Labor is still sniffing the breeze on whether to adopt a reservation policy of its own. For now, as the factions fume inside Australia's notoriously back-stabbing gas industry, some are hinting that fallout and recriminations are on the cards. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     In the meantime, the apparent political naivety over Dutton's modus operandi will not come as a surprise to other parts of Australia's big-business community. Dutton has no love for the top end of town, and while he might be friendly with them in private, he has shown an easy willingness to sell them down the creek. Whether it's supermarket or insurance giants, Dutton has been pretty consistent. He is more than ready to trample standard Liberal Party fealty to big business and come down on the side of small business. Big corporations are too ""woke"", in his view, focused on supporting social campaigns like the Voice rather than standing up for core matters like tax or industrial relations reform. ""It's a level of weakness that doesn't serve our country, our country's best interests,"" Dutton told mortgage entrepreneur Mark Bouris on his Straight Talk podcast in January. The test for both leaders is to convince voters they have a plan for the country. Dutton might be on a winner with a gas reservation, but voters will need assurance it can make a difference in the near term. Even as the experts warn there is no silver bullet. The problems of the gas industry aren't new. And if they were easy to fix, someone would have done it a long time ago.

Both major parties want less migration. The numbers say it's already falling,"With net migration tumbling from great heights, experts say 'surge' talk is overblown",2025-03-30 08:19:38,"Australia's migration surge is receding faster than it grew, with the total number of temporary residents well on its way to pre-pandemic levels even as migration shapes as a prominent election issue. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has seized on the record levels of net migration over the last two years, accusing Labor of a ""Big Australia policy"" that has exacerbated the housing crisis. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail ""Labor's brought in a million people over two years through the migration program, which is a record for our country,"" Mr Dutton said on Friday. Keep up with all the major commitments promised by Labor and the Coalition as they campaign for Australia's vote. ""Now, all of those people need homes to live in, and that's why Australians have found it really hard to find a house, to either buy a house or rent a house, under Mr Albanese."" Economists including the Grattan Institute's Brendan Coates have supported the view that the increase in temporary migration added to existing pressure in the housing market, particularly the rental market. But official figures show the numbers are now falling at a rate of 100,000 people per year since peaking at 536,000 in 2022-23. That rate is enough for a swift return to pre-pandemic levels. The budget papers indicate similar, forecasting a return to 260,000 in the upcoming financial year and to 225,000 the year after that — although budget projections consistently underestimated net migration numbers during the surge. Net migration measures the ""flow"" of migrants in and out of Australia each year. More relevant for the debate about housing demand is the ""stock"" — that is, the total number of migrants present in Australia at any one time. These figures differ significantly, since most temporary migrants stay for more than a year at a time. But the stock is also on track to return to pre-pandemic norms. It plummeted to record lows during the pandemic as many international students and temporary workers returned home. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage It rose again after the pandemic for two main reasons. First, arrivals spiked through ""pent-up"" demand from students, backpackers and temporary workers who had wanted to come during the pandemic years but were unable. Second, the rate of departures plummeted as the Morrison and Albanese governments extended visa decisions. While international students have been the focal point of political debate, this pattern was seen most clearly in British and Irish backpackers, whose numbers surged to almost 50 per cent more than previous norms after they were allowed to stay for up to three years. Angus Taylor confirms the Coalition plans to reduce overall government spending growth and temporary migrant numbers, but says figures will be finalised after Tuesday's budget.  By contrast, international student numbers have already receded to around pre-pandemic norms, and the overall number of departures saw a gradual uptick in late 2024. ANU migration experts Peter McDonald and Alan Gamlen said the timing of these extensions meant a big spike in departures was looming in 2027, which could see migration plummet to record lows without any further government intervention. In a recently published working paper, the pair said migration numbers had been ""weaponised … to elicit panic and sway voters,"" but that the numbers did not support the political attention. ""Migration is already falling faster than it rose… This does not seem like a situation that should give rise to election-generated panic about high migration levels. ""In fact, the bigger risk is that undue panic could induce knee-jerk migration cuts that cause migration levels to whipsaw up and down, instead of settling back into a more stable normal."" Mr Dutton has promised to cut the number of international students and to reduce the permanent migrant intake by 25 per cent. The details of the permanent migration cut have not yet been outlined, apart from a cut to the humanitarian program, which accounts for a small fraction of the total. Labor has already moved to limit the number of international students, which it has done by ministerial direction after an attempt to legislate caps was blocked by the Coalition.

He believes he's more right-wing than his parents and proudly identifies as a conservative. Oliver Griffiths says he leans more right than his parents. (ABC NEWS: Billy Cooper) Young men in other democracies have been embracing right-wing, populist leaders, a trend seen in the most recent elections in the United States, Germany, Poland and South Korea. In Australia, some data now suggests there is an emerging gender divide amongst the country's youngest voters. ""Australia does mirror some of the gender gap trends, but with a bit of a twist,"" said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University. Gen Z men, born between 1996 and 2012, were more likely to vote for the Coalition compared to their female peers, Dr Chowdhury found in her analysis of a post-election study from 2022. But the survey also found that, overall, gen Z is more progressive than previous generations; only 26 per cent backed the Coalition, with 67 per cent backing either the Greens or Labor. ""Among the younger generations, the [gender] gap is increasing, but both men and women are moving to the left,"" Dr Chowdhury said of the data from the Australian Election Study compiled after each poll by leading universities. ""The gender gap is kind of widening, but still in the left — not necessarily men and women going in different directions like we see in the US.""

Abbey grew up in a conservative area on the New South Wales coast and was introduced to politics by her family, but says her university studies have shifted her views on some issues. Abbey Dawson helps run the University of Wollongong’s Liberal Club with Oliver Griffiths but the pair don't agree on everything. (ABC NEWS: Billy Cooper) Oliver said he thought his female friends were a lot more invested in social justice. ""I think men are a lot more skeptical and black and white … if they think something feels wrong to them, they're just going to stick with the fact that it's wrong and not explore it,"" he said. Social media and algorithms are increasingly shaping the political choices of younger generations, according to technology and politics experts. Political parties are leveraging digital platforms more than ever before, working with online personalities and content creators to get their message out to younger voters. Newer forms of media, including platforms like podcasts and YouTube, might be among the factors driving political polarisation among the genders, said Raffaele Ciriello, a digital innovation researcher at the University of Sydney. ""We've seen the advent of social media platforms, and the echo chambers it creates, it can often lead to people segregating into communities of like-minded people,"" he said. Raffaello Cirriello says newer forms of media helped Donald Trump reach young men in the US. (ABC NEWS: Billy Cooper) ""There is growing evidence now by some analysts, that podcasts like [the Joe Rogan Experience] played an influential role in the US 2024 presidential election. ""That influence saw a historic shift to the right and particularly among young male voters."" Dr Ciriello said social media had also made it easier for people to spread misinformation. As Oliver Griffiths scrolls through his TikTok feed, there's plenty of political and right-wing content. In Australia, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton appears to be replicating some of the strategies and content seen in the 2024 US election. Experts say social media and algorithms are increasingly shaping the politics of younger people.

Labor commits to outlaw supermarket price gouging if re-elected,"Labor sets election promise to outlaw supermarket price gouging, after inquiry could not substantiate allegations",2025-03-30 09:08:05,"The government will commit to make it illegal for supermarkets to price-gouge customers if re-elected, several days after an inquiry they commissioned said it could not substantiate allegations the practice was taking place. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will announce plans on Sunday to establish a taskforce to advise on an ""excessive pricing regime"" to be policed by the consumer watchdog, on top of adopting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) supermarket inquiry's recommendations as a ""first step"". Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail But the inquiry's final report — which was handed down earlier this month after a year of hearings — said the watchdog was unable to conclude whether price gouging was taking place. While it said Coles and Woolworths had little incentive to compete hard on prices, the watchdog stopped short of finding that grocery prices were ""excessive"" or that the two major players had a duopoly. Anthony Albanese visited a Medicare clinic in Brisbane on the first day of the campaign, where the cost of living was a major focus. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) In his first major interview of the campaign, Mr Albanese told ABC's Insiders that supermarkets caught price gouging would face stiff penalties. ""People know when they're being ripped off, and we want to crack down on supermarkets,"" Mr Albanese said. ""We want to make sure consumers are looked after, this is one of the measures we are taking. ""We'll fine them, with heavy fines, to make sure they know if they're ripping people off, then they are in the gun to pay a heavy penalty for it."" The prime minister, however, did not offer a definition for what would be considered price gouging, saying that would be part of the work of the taskforce. Asked later to provide a definition, Mr Albanese responded: ""How do you know what's price gouging? Price gouging is when supermarkets are taking the piss,"" he said. That taskforce would include Treasury and the ACCC, along with other stakeholders who would be instructed to consider what laws other countries have and whether they could work in Australia. It would be directed to report back to government after six months with a way forward, with the prime minister promising legislation by the end of the year. Coalition campaign spokesman James Paterson said his party would be ""happy to make [price gouging] illegal"", but the Coalition had a better plan to create divestiture powers that could be used to break-up the supermarket giants if they were behaving anti-competitively. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Responding to the announcement, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said it was an attempt to distract. ""This is the sixth policy review the prime minister has offered in three years, prices have gone up thirty per cent in three years. I would say the prime minister is as weak as water,"" Mr Dutton said. ""Where supermarkets act against the interest of consumers we will act, I promise you."" Mr Dutton said if the laws around price gouging were insufficient his government would change the law. In January last year, the federal government directed the ACCC to investigate whether price gouging was taking place as part of a wider probe into the supermarket sector, after allegations swirled during the pandemic and the subsequent cost-of-living crisis. Labor said it would adopt the 20 recommendations of the inquiry, which included that supermarkets should be forced to publish pricing information, be subject to ""minimum information requirements"" for discount price promotions and notify customers of package size changes. Keep up with all the major commitments promised by Labor and the Coalition as they campaign for Australia's vote. The announcement comes just days before the government's new mandatory food and grocery code of conduct comes into force on April 1, which could see supermarkets fined up to $10 million for serious breaches. Labor has also boosted the ACCC's funding by more than $30 million over three and a half years so they can investigate and take enforcement action on the supermarket and retail sector. The Coalition has vowed to take action on the supermarket giants, including to legislate break-up powers that could be used as a last resort if Coles and Woolworths were found to be taking advantage of customers. Nationals leader David Littleproud had long agitated for divestiture powers, but the announcement of the plan in July angered some Liberal MPs who feared it would result in costly ""lawfare"". Labor has so far opted against going down the path of break-up powers after a review led by former Labor minister Craig Emerson warned against it, recommending instead a mandatory code of conduct. ""Our plan helps deliver more competition, fairer prices and better deals for Australians,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers. ""We're delivering a better deal for families at the check-out and a better deal for farmers at the farm gate."" The leaders of both major parties hyped policies they said would ease hip pocket pain at campaign events half an hour's drive from one another in Brisbane on Saturday, as the five-week race to election day kicked off officially.

Just when you thought election season was over, another one is bearing down. In what's expected to be a close race across the country, every vote in the Federal Election will count. So how could your vote influence the result on May 3? The bottom line is, it will likely come down to these seats: Held with a 1.3 per cent swing to independent Kate Chaney It's one of the state's most marginal seats, so expect there to be a lot of focus on the affluent, leafy streets of Curtin in Perth's western suburbs. Kate Chaney turned the Liberal stronghold teal at the last election but holds on by just a 1.3 per cent margin. She's spent the past three years pushing for issues like climate action and decarbonisation (including supporting Nature Positive reforms which failed to pass Parliament in this term) and transparency and integrity in politics. Trying to win it back for the Liberals is Tom White — who spent nine years working for Uber, rising from opening Perth's first office to running its operations in South Korea. The party's throwing a lot behind his campaign, with Peter Dutton speaking at the official launch, which was attended by former premiers Richard Court and Colin Barnett. Tom White says he does not fear a battle with Kate Chaney in Curtin. (ABC News: Kema Johnson) Mr White told the event he was the ""underdog"" in the contest, adding: ""I am not afraid of a battle of ideas. I am not afraid of the teals."" The electorate overlaps significantly with the state seat of Churchlands — which new Liberal leader Basil Zempilas won with the smallest swing in the state, holding on by just 636 votes. That was a much smaller win than the party had been hoping for and could indicate Mr White's task could be bigger than the Liberals would like. While cost of living was a key issue among voters the ABC spoke to, it wasn't the only one. 1 /

3 New seat but notionally held with a 3.3 per cent swing to Labor Bullwinkel should be the most interesting contest to watch in WA over the next five weeks. The date is set, and here's your cheat sheet to the 2025 Australian federal election. It's a new seat that stretches from Perth's fringes, including Kalamunda, Forrestfield and High Wycombe, out to Northam, York and Toodyay in the east. On paper, it's a Labor seat with a 3.3 per cent margin — but both the Nationals and Liberals are throwing a lot at the race to try and pick it up. And they've got some reasons to hope, because a lot of the state seats within Bullwinkel's boundaries had strong swings towards the Liberals earlier this month. The Liberals have drafted journalist-turned Army public affairs officer Matt Moran for their campaign. Matt Moran is the Liberal candidate in the new seat of Bullwinkel. (ABC News: Keane Bourke) He was joined by former prime minister John Howard at a campaign event last year. ""If we don't win Bullwinkel, we don't win government,"" Mr Moran said Liberal leader Peter Dutton had told him. The Nationals have called in former state opposition leader Mia Davies after her retirement from state politics. They are on a high after picking up six seats at the WA election — more than expected — something federal leader David Littleproud said was down to people understanding the party represents more than the bush. ""We took that first step at the state election, and it'll be baby steps, but with someone like Mia you pose that opportunity to have that star power quality that'll actually hopefully turbocharge that at the federal election,"" he said after Ms Davies's campaign launch. Labor's candidate, nurse Trish Cook, was announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in September and appeared alongside him on his last visit west earlier this month. The prime minister visited Bullwinkel with Trish Cook during his most recent trip west. (ABC News: Keane Bourke) ""Nothing says WA more than a nurse who used to work in the oil and gas sector and has worked around regional WA,"" Mr Albanese said. This is an area where you'd expect the Coalition's promise to halve the fuel excise for a year to land particularly well, with many voters telling the ABC that cost of living was front of mind. 1 /

3 Western Australia played a key role in delivering Anthony Albanese the keys to The Lodge in 2022, because of four seats. With marginal seats everywhere and a range of third party challenges, there are plenty of storylines to watch. Those electorates — Tangney (on a 2.8 per cent margin), Pearce (8.8 per cent), Swan (9.4 per cent) and Hasluck (10 per cent) — will be important for Labor to hang onto power, or for the Liberals to take it back. The challenge for the Liberals across the state, but particularly in these seats, is encouraging voters dissatisfied with Labor to vote for them. Because at the state election (which isn't always a reliable indicator of what happens federally) the Liberals got just a third of voters who swung away from Labor. That wasn't the case in Pearce, though, where all four state seats within its boundaries recorded double-digit swings to the blue, boosting the party's hopes. The swings were much smaller in another traditional Liberal heartland though — Tangney, which Labor was surprised to win with dolphin trainer-turned-police officer-turned MP Sam Lim. Voters the ABC spoke to in Canning Vale, within Tangney, agreed that cost of living was front of mind. 1 /
of
3 Beyond that, both Moore and Canning will be interesting. The Liberals hold Moore on just 0.9 per cent, but their current member, Ian Goodenough, wasn't pre-selected and is now running as an independent against the party's Vince Connelly — who had been the MP for Stirling before that seat was abolished. On paper, Canning is also a close contest thanks to the high-water mark Labor achieved in the seat in 2022 — reducing Andrew Hastie's margin to 1.2 per cent — although he is expected to be re-elected. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. From the leaders' movements already, we can see signs of how interested they are in WA. Peter Dutton's been ramping up the number of times he's ventured across the Nullarbor recently and no doubt will be making the trip a few more times before May 3. The prime minister made a big deal of making 29 visits west so far in the top job — expect a few more over the next few weeks as he tries to keep WA Labor's momentum from the state election running into his campaign. Just don't expect the premier to be jumping on the federal campaign trail too soon, though. He's busy riding (and recovering from) on a 140km cycle raising money for youth mental health.

"Dutton sees path to minority government, while both leaders declare they can win majority — as it happened","Federal election 2025: Dutton sees path to minority government, while both leaders declare they can win majority — as it happened",2025-03-29 17:12:13,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton both focused on Queensland for their first full day of campaigning in the federal election. Australians are due to head to the polls on May 3, meaning Labor and the Coalition have five weeks to persuade voters that they should form the next government. Take a look back at how the day unfolded with our live blog below. By Andrew Thorpe We're going to wrap up today's live blog here — thanks so much for joining us. We'll be back early tomorrow morning to keep you in the loop as Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton criss-cross the country in the battle for The Lodge. In the meantime, why not take a look back at more of today's federal election coverage at our Australia Votes page below? Take a deep breath, and say it with me — just 35 more days until polling day. Catch you tomorrow. By Andrew Thorpe  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is rounding out the day by appearing with Eden-Monaro MP Kristy McBain in Bega, where he takes questions from local media. It's grey and drizzly, but the PM appears upbeat as he talks up a grab-bag of Labor policies and boasts that the government's newly announced funding of the Bega War Memorial Pool went through the budget process well before this election campaign. By Andrew Thorpe The prime minister has left Queensland, flying out of Bundaberg earlier this afternoon (as did the press pack). Anthony Albanese has one more event scheduled today — a visit to the Bega War Memorial Pool with Eden-Monaro MP Kristy McBain. By Andrew Thorpe Nationals leader David Littleproud says the response to the flooding currently impacting his electorate of Maranoa ""should match what was required in the 2019 floods"" that struck north-west Queensland. ""Immediate, large-scale support is desperately needed for western Queensland,"" he says. ""This disaster requires a bipartisan approach, to ensure locals get the assistance they need. We back any measure in relation to providing support, including the request of the Australian Defence Force, if that is made by the Queensland government."" Littleproud says he's spoken with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Queensland Premier David Crisafulli to thank them for working together to ensure Category D funding for flood-impacted victims will be provided by the federal government, plus $2.5 million in joint funding to drop fodder for impacted cattle. ""The full extent of the damage is still unknown but it's important my community knows they are not alone during this crisis,"" he says. ""Our outback locals are some of the most resilient people in Australia, but at times like this, they need to know that there is support available and I thank the government for working with me to ensure this will be provided."" By Defence correspondent Andrew Greene Increased security measures have been put in place around Darwin Harbour due to the presence of a US nuclear submarine which has docked near a Chinese-owned port. The USS Minnesota is visiting the Northern Territory capital along with another US logistics vessel, the USS Emory S. Land, after conducting exercises out of Western Australia's HMAS Stirling naval base. Defence Minister Richard Marles, who greeted American sailors on the submarine earlier today, won't say if the Trump administration has expressed concerns about the continuing lease of Darwin Port by Chinese-owned company Landbridge. ""With additional security that's been provided by the Northern Territory government, by ourselves, [and] with the Americans' own security, they were very complimentary about this specific visit and the way in which they have been handled,"" Marles says. ""So that's very important, and we're very pleased in that sense that this visit is going off in the way that it is."" By Andrew Thorpe National Party leader David Littleproud is in his electorate of Maranoa in western Queensland today, which has been hit by record flooding. Speaking from Quilpie, Littleproud tells the ABC he's concerned about what's going to happen in Thargomindah tonight. ""I spoke to the mayor, Tractor Ferguson, there this morning, and as he quoted it to me, this is a monster that's coming his way, and they're putting up a levee as we speak,"" he says. ""The stock losses [in Quilpie] and right up towards Winton are going to be enormous — this is a repeat of the north-west Queensland floods of 2019."" Nationals Leader David Littleproud in Quilpie where record-level floods persist Asked whether the Coalition plans to release the modelling of its gas reservation plan reportedly produced by Frontier Economics, Littleproud echoes earlier statements by Peter Dutton that ""there'll be plenty of experts that have run the ruler over what we are saying"". ""You only have to look to the lived experience of the all-renewables approach that we're going [with] at the moment, that we're continuing to see the price go up,"" he says."" ""You can only fix this if you get supply in to reduce the price."" Nationals Leader David Littleproud on the Coalition's campaign policies By Olivia Caisley Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has been heckled by a climate protester at a campaign event for the second time today. Dutton was greeting supporters at Golden Lane — a Chinese restaurant in the Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank — when the event was briefly disrupted by a protester who yelled out ""Stop lying!"" before being bundled out by security. It's unclear how she gained access to the event. The opposition leader later pledged $225,000 to the Chinese Museum of Queensland to improve its website and take the first steps towards its goal of building a physical museum in Brisbane. ""The Chinese Museum of Queensland is a testament to the achievement of modern Australia and the significant contributions Chinese Australians have made to our country,"" he said. Golden Lane is located in the seat of Moreton, held by retiring Labor MP Graham Perrett. Both the LNP and the Greens have the electorate in their sights. By Tom Lowrey It's been a pretty comfortable start to the election campaign for Anthony Albanese. Flanked by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers — who happens to be arguably the best communicator in his team — the PM travelled to Peter Dutton's backyard to kick off his re-election bid. It's a long way from how things were this time three years ago. In his first press conference of the last campaign, Albanese totally bungled a question on the RBA cash rate, and derailed his campaign in its first few hours. It took a long time to recover, and a mid-campaign break after being struck down with COVID wound up seeming particularly helpful. Labor's campaign this time around seems designed to be very far from those memories. He's spent his first full day on the campaign trail visiting two seats it would take a miracle for Labor to flip, trying to project as much confidence as possible. And having Chalmers fielding questions helps remind voters there's more to Labor than just the PM, who polls suggest doesn't carry the popularity this time as he did going into the last campaign. When asked about his disastrous start to the 2022 campaign, he explicitly turned to the strength of his senior colleagues, pointing also to Health Minister Mark Butler while conveniently forgetting the name of Butler's Coalition counterpart (Anne Ruston). If it was a genuine lapse of memory, it's not one he'll be kicking himself about like last time around. By Elissa Steedman The federal election has been called, and Australia's political parties have begun putting the hard sell on the voting public. Here, ANU professor Mark Kenny discusses what strategies the major parties will use. How will major parties campaign to persuade voters? By Elissa Steedman Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles is being quizzed on the Port Darwin lease. A 99-year lease was granted to Chinese-owned Landbridge Group in 2015. ""The port should never have been leased in this way, and that's been our position from the get-go,"" he says. He tells reporters how the lease is managed is a matter for the NT, but ""we keep engaging with the Northern Territory government on this issue"". He refuses to be drawn further on discussing whether the federal government would intervene. By Elissa Steedman We're heading to another press conference — this time in Darwin with Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. They come thick and fast on the election campaign! Marles announced a $10 million commitment to establish a community hub in Zuccoli if Labor is re-elected. He said it was a recognition by the Albanese government of the needs of local communities. By Andrew Thorpe In case you missed it, independent MP Andrew Gee — formerly of the Nationals — seemed to have committed a familiar social media faux pas yesterday, when his official Facebook account replied to its own post in what appeared to be an attempt to impersonate a constituent. ""Thank you Andrew Gee MP I am new to the area and have received multiple texts from the Nationals and seen nasty ads in the paper from the Teal mob, it has helped me see who is the good guy!"" the comment said. To make matters worse, the original post was calling out his former party for ""dirty tactics"" in the election campaign. The comment was soon deleted, but the original post remains live — and a spokesman for Gee's campaign later blamed a staffer for the blunder. ""The comment was posted without Mr Gee's knowledge by a new and inexperienced member of the campaign team who had access to the page, and knows it was an extremely disappointing and unacceptable thing to do and which Mr Gee does not condone, approve of or support under any circumstances,"" the spokesman said, according to The Daily Telegraph. ""The team member has expressed genuine remorse and distress, their duties have now been modified so it won't happen again and we're providing appropriate levels of care and support."" Of course, I can't help but be reminded of the legendary post from now-shadow treasurer Angus Taylor, who congratulated himself during the 2019 campaign by commenting ""Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus"" on one of his own videos. By Elissa Steedman Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has taken a few shots at Opposition Leader Peter Dutton over his foreign policy and the party's gas reserve plan. ""Peter Dutton gave a so-called foreign policy speech last week — ... he didn't mention Japan, Korea, China, India, Indonesia, he actually didn't mention ASEAN at all, which is really quite... shows you what the map of the world, according to Peter Dutton, might look like,"" she says.  Wong turns her sights to his energy policies. First, she says Resources Minister Madeleine King has secured ""six times more gas supply for the domestic market"" than Dutton's gas reserves plan promises to achieve. She adds that Dutton ""really wants you to believe he cares about domestic gas"". ""Well, he voted against price caps, he voted against the code of conduct, which has enabled more gas to be supplied to the Australian market.  ""This is Peter Dutton re-heating a failed Scott Morrison announcement."" By Elissa Steedman Let's dash over to Perth now, where Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong is speaking. She tells those present that the most recent round of tax cuts should not be considered in isolation. ""[They] build on the tax cuts we have already put in place,"" she says. ""So in total, when you add up what we've done and the two rounds of tax cuts we are proposing, should we be elected, it is about $2,500 a year,"" she says. She notes the Coalition's proposed fuel excise cuts would only last 12 months. ""But this is a bloke who has opposed every cost-of-living measure that has been rolled out, and opposes future tax cuts, and our tax cuts are permanent,"" she says. ""You know, you keep getting them, and we will keep building on them. That has been our record.""  By Elissa Steedman Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is asked what his message is to voters who have moved away from the major parties. ""You can't govern the country with 150 independents,"" he replies. ""You need to govern a country with a Cabinet. ""I lead a majority government with 78 seats. That has brought stability, it has brought order, and we replaced a government that was chaotic, frankly, and my government, I believe, deserves to be re-elected."" By Elissa Steedman Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is using his visit to the factory to highlight his government's Future Made In Australia plan.  Among a few of the plan's main focuses is increasing Australian manufacturing. ""We want more manufacturing here, more jobs created here, we want to celebrate what is here,"" Albanese says. ""The world's best ginger beer, and out in the road, when you combine it with another Bundy product, the world's best dark and stormy.""  He reflects on the company's ""great future"" ahead. ""This company is iconic. ""It employs directly over 230 people, but indirectly, many times more than that. ""Everything from the local ginger that is grown here, through to the advanced manufacturing that we've seen here, at this facility, but also at their new facility that I opened up the road, about a year ago now."" By Andrew Thorpe The prime minister and treasurer have joined Industry Minister Ed Husic and Hinkler candidate Trish Mears in Bundaberg, where they're spruiking Labor's previously announced $20 million campaign to encourage shoppers to buy Australian-made products. As my colleague Tom Lowrey mentioned earlier, they've chosen the Bundaberg Brewed Drinks factory for their photo op. It's important to note this is the Bundaberg factory that produces ginger beer, not the Bundaberg Rum distillery a few minutes up the road (which is owned by a different company). Either way, it's a sort of odd bookend to the morning's campaigning after Peter Dutton earlier visited the XXXX brewery in inner Brisbane. By Elissa Steedman Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is addressing party faithful at the Eatons Hill Hotel in his electorate of Dickson. After being interrupted by climate protesters at his press conference at the XXXX Brewery, this gathering presents much friendlier territory. By Tom Lowrey Anthony Albanese is keeping up the campaigning in Queensland, touching down in Bundaberg on the state's east coast. Not many have eyes on Central Queensland this campaign. Seats like Hinkler and Flynn are held on fairly comfortable margins, and Labor has had trouble making inroads up here in recent years. Debate over the Adani coal mine cost Labor in 2019, and while the vote swung back in 2022, it wasn't nearly enough to cover the party's earlier losses. But the PM is bringing his ""Buy Australian"" message to Bundy. He's heading for the Bundaberg Brewed Drinks ginger beer factory, presumably with an intent to sample the goods. By Claudia Long In Australia, voting entails more than just ticking a box. But with the majority of teenagers not passing their civics test, you probably know someone who needs a refresher on how it works even if they're out of high school. We've got a preferential system, meaning you'll need to choose who you want to represent you most, least and everything in between. It might sound complicated, but it's actually really straightforward. We've explained everything you need to know about it here.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-29/federal-election-025-live-updates-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton/105111418
Two SA seats will be hotly contested in the federal election,Federal election love descends on marginal seats — will SA get much?,2025-03-29 06:34:08,"Voters in South Australia could be forgiven for feeling a little bit forgotten in recent federal elections, having watched leaders from both parties heavily focus their campaigning efforts in other parts of the country. The reason is basic mathematics. The number of crucial electoral battlegrounds — the marginal seats which will decide who holds the keys to the Lodge after May 3 — in other states easily outstrips those in South Australia. There are only two seats seen by the major parties as genuinely competitive in the state at this election. One is Sturt, a seat in Adelaide's east and north-east suburbs, held by the Liberals for the past half century but one where Labor sniffs a potential for a gain. The other is Boothby, where Liberal Nicolle Flint is trying to regain her old seat but needs a swing of 3.28 per cent to do so. Former Liberal MP Nicolle Flint is recontesting the seat of Boothby. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Two marginal seats in SA is a slight uptick on some recent elections, where there was only one seen as legitimately up for grabs, but it's still nothing compared to other parts of the country. By the Electoral Commission's definition, New South Wales has 14 marginal seats, there are 13 in Victoria, 11 in Queensland and seven in Western Australia. More to be gained in those states likely means more visits from the leaders and potentially more funds in the form of election promises for those parts of the country. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese speaking to workers in Whyalla last month. (ABC News: Che Chorley) In the shadow campaign which has been raging for months, if not years, neither Prime Minister Anthony Albanese or Opposition Leader Peter Dutton have been a particularly frequent visitor to SA. Mr Albanese did head to Whyalla last month with a big cash injection in hand, as part of the state and federal government intervention into the town's troubled steelworks. And, as well as visiting Adelaide in late February, Mr Dutton may see SA as an opportunity to build his case for nuclear power — with a power station planned for Port Augusta under the Coalition's policy. The Whyalla steelworks has already attracted federal funding commitments. (ABC News: Che Chorley) As it fights to maintain — and boost — its numbers in SA, one thing will be giving Labor confidence. It has been an utterly dominant few years for the party in the state. In 2022, it made history by toppling a one-term Liberal state government. A few months later, it ended more than 70 years of Liberal representation in the federal seat of Boothby. Opposition leader Peter Dutton speaks to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide last year. (ABC News: Che Chorley) Then, in early 2024, it became the first SA government to take a seat from an opposition at a by-election in more than a century when it won the seat that had been held by former premier Steven Marshall. Eight months later it repeated the same trick, winning the seat of Black. Now the federal poll presents an opportunity for Labor to continue its streak when it attempts to win the seat of Sturt for the first time since 1972. Incumbent Liberal James Stevens is in the seat, formerly held by Christopher Pyne, on fairly safe margin. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage But a big swing in 2022 means Labor now needs a gain of only 0.45 per cent to win. University of Adelaide Emeritus Professor of politics Clem Macintyre said the popularity of the state Labor government would not necessarily translate federally. ""If the Premier campaigns hard in the seat of Sturt then that may make a difference but not as much of a difference as the local factors did at the Dunstan by-election,"" he said. The Greens could also be something of a factor, with the party feeling optimism after its vote surged at the by-election in Dunstan — which is within Sturt's boundaries. Professor Macintyre  said the Greens's confidence in Sturt had been boosted after the party's vote surged at the Dunstan by-election. But he said that surge would not necessarily be replicated at this election because Sturt was bigger than Dunstan and took in ""a more diverse group of voters"". South Australia's two marginal seats are Boothby and Sturt. (AAP: Richard Wainwright) Professor Macintyre expected the addition of SA's first teal candidate, retired GP Verity Cooper, to ""complicate matters"" for Mr Stevens. ""If she is able to take any votes from the Liberals, and if they don't come back to James Stevens as preferences, then clearly he's going to be in some trouble,"" he said. He said while Sturt was ""a really tough seat to call"", Labor had set its sights on it several times before — and had fallen just short. ""I'm not sure that I've seen enough yet, at this stage of the campaign, to suggest they'll get over the line this time,"" he said. David Speers presents Australia's must-watch political program, joined by a panel of the best political analysts and commentators. Stream now on ABC iview. Professor Macintyre said cost-of-living would be on the minds of Sturt voters, but not to the same extent as in other marginal seats. ""That's not to say that cost-of-living pressures and mortgage rates won't be a factor in Sturt, but I think it's less of an issue there than it is in the big eastern states,"" he said. While Labor is hopeful in Sturt, there is a level of risk for the Albanese government elsewhere. Louise Miller-Frost won Boothby for Labor in 2022. But Ms Flint, who chose not to recontest the seat in 2022 but is now attempting a political comeback, has won the historically Liberal electorate twice before. While these two seats will be fiercely fought, there is a lack of other races seen by political operatives on both sides as likely to be close. Labor's Louise Miller-Frost on the night she won the seat of Boothby in 2022. (ABC News: Rory McClaren) By margin, the next closest seat in SA is Hindmarsh — held by Mark Butler on a margin of nearly 9 per cent, which is unlikely to be giving the Health Minister too many sleepless nights. Of course, all parties will insist they take no seat for granted and they will be trying to win every electorate.

Why don't we have a set date for elections?,When is the federal election? Why isn't it on a set date?,2025-03-29 09:22:28,"Before the date of this year's election was officially set this week, there was a lot of speculation about when Australians would be voting.   Countries such as the US have set election dates, with American voters going to the polls to pick their next president on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November every four years. But Australia does things differently.  While we'll always vote on a Saturday, the rules around prime ministerial elections are a little more fluid — meaning the dates can change.  Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Saturday, May 3. That's in five weeks' time.  And that's also a long weekend for Queensland and Northern Territory residents — Monday 5. May 21, 2022.  The election date changes every time, but elections are always held on a Saturday. (AAP: Richard Wainwright) Generally speaking, we vote in federal elections about every three years.  In federal elections, we vote for candidates vying for a position in either: or Elections for the two chambers don't have to happen at the same time, but they're usually combined to save the effort and cost of running two separate elections.  Senators from the states have six-year terms but they aren't all elected at once — half are elected three years after the other cohort.  Usually, their terms end on June 30 at the end of those six years.  So this means that, every three years, half the senators' terms end on June 30.  The exception is for the four senators representing the ACT and Northern Territory, who face election every time. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage The House of Representatives term limits are a little more fluid.  Here's what the Australian Constitution says on that: ""Every House of Representatives shall continue for three years from the first meeting of the House, and no longer, but may be sooner dissolved by the Governor-General."" That means they have to be held every three years, but can happen before those three years are up.  So, technically, an election can be called at any time — but it's ""highly unlikely"" that a governor-general would approve an election within a government's first year if it has a majority, parliament researcher Damon Muller says. Federal elections generally combine votes for House of Representatives and Senate candidates.  (ABC News: Ruby Littler) Because there's no set date in the Australian constitution.  This gives the government of the day the flexibility to call an election sooner.  The party in power at the time.  The sitting prime minister is the person who makes the announcement, but it's likely they'd have consulted with other party members anld staff before picking the date.  First, the government needs to ask the governor-general to dissolve House of Representatives — which means ending the current term for the members of parliament (MPs).  Once the house has been dissolved, the writs need to be issued. A writ is just a formal word for a legal document — but in the context of an election, it's a document written by the governor-general that: There's a writ for both the House of Representatives and the Senate for each state and territory, which is why you'll hear people using the plural ""writs"" instead of a singular ""writ"".

"Whoever wins the election, a $100b budget black hole awaits",A $100 billion budget black hole awaits whoever wins the election,2025-03-29 13:15:38,"The federal budget deficit could be ten times larger than expected within a decade whoever wins the upcoming election, new analysis suggests, with neither major party offering voters a realistic solution to cope with growing pressure to spend. Labor’s fourth budget on Tuesday confirmed the first two budget surpluses in 15 years would be followed by a decade-long return to deficits, with Treasury projecting the imbalance between spending and revenue would only disappear in 2035-36. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail But analysis by the e61 Institute suggests that even this assessment is “built on fanciful assumptions”, with the deficit realistically closer to $100 billion in that year, nearly ten times larger than the budget papers suggest. “The major parties appear hesitant to grasp the nettle on budget repair, [which] requires raising taxes or decreasing spending,” authors Aaron Wong and Lachlan Vass said. “The current implicit strategy appears to [be to] rely on non-credible increases in income tax through bracket creep, and to cross our fingers and hope no new significant expenditures arise.  “In addition to being unrealistic, this approach creates uncertainty for households and firms.” Peter Dutton's budget reply speech suggested only modest differences in the Coalition's bottom line to Labor's offering, although further details await. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) The Labor budget included $35 billion in new pre-election offers to voters, headlined by cheaper PBS medicines, bulk billing incentives, energy bill relief, and a “modest” tax cut starting in the middle of next year. The Coalition matched the spending measures but not the $17 billion tax cut, promising to repeal it and instead halve the fuel excise for a year at a cost of $6 billion. That, alongside a pledge to slash 41,000 public service jobs and save $7 billion a year, leaves the opposition some headroom to make additional campaign promises and still offer voters a stronger bottom line than Labor’s, as it has promised. After the prime minister's dawn visit to Government House, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton's five-week race to convince voters they should lead the country is officially underway.  But the Coalition has to fund several commitments of its own, including a $5 billion housing fund, a boost to defence spending, and the long-term cost of building nuclear power plants, meaning any difference is likely to be modest. The e61 analysis, which uses a tool provided by the Parliamentary Budget Office to make budget projections with different assumptions, argues both parties would see a budget blowout thanks to defence spending, flagging productivity, and the need to continually return bracket creep to taxpayers. Even a modest increase in defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP instead of Labor’s proposed 2.33 per cent, would alone double the size of the budget deficit. “A balanced budget in any given year is not necessarily important in and of itself… Some degree of government borrowing is likely,"" the authors said. ""However, if the stock of debt is too high, or plans [to reduce it] not credible, the government’s ability to respond to future crises through borrowing will be restricted.” Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Independent economist Saul Eslake said the solution was more likely to involve tax rises than spending growth, given the enormous cost pressure in health and social care and defence. The government has made a last-minute decision to bring its budget centrepiece to a vote in parliament. “It’s difficult to see how spending can be cut in other areas sufficiently to offset the increase in [care and defence spending],” he said. “Cutting the number of public servants, as proposed by the opposition, won’t do that – wages and salaries of government employees, including military personnel, represent just 6.4 per cent” of government spending. Breaking down Labor's last four federal budgets “Ideally, both sides of politics would, between now and the next election, be having an ‘adult conversation’ with the electorate as to what would be the least economically damaging, and fairest, ways of raising the additional revenue required to pay for the additional spending… “But there’s a greater probability of my spotting a thylacine on my front lawn of a morning, than of that happening.

'Populist' and a 'betrayal': Leading gas expert lets rip on Dutton plan,Energy expert slams Dutton's 'populist anti-market' gas plan as self-defeating 'betrayal',2025-03-29 13:09:07,"One of the nation's leading energy experts and prominent Labor critics has blasted Peter Dutton's gas reservation plan as a ""populist anti-market betrayal of the sector"" that repeats the same mistakes the Coalition accused the government of making. A cornerstone of his opening election campaign pitch, Mr Dutton on Thursday vowed to force gas giants to supply the local market at a discounted $10 per gigajoule, a move aimed at driving down energy bills. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail But Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Marquee said the Coalition's plan would result in less gas being available to Australian users and potentially forcing exporters to curb shipments destined for valued regional allies including Japan. He also likened it to Labor's notorious 2022 election promise that household energy bills would fall under its watch. Saul Kavonic said the Coalition's policy was a 'betrayal' and fell into a similar trap to what the Coalition has accused Labor of. (ABC News: John Gunn) ""The Coalition have boxed themselves in here just like Labor did with its $275 lower price position,"" Kavonic wrote in a note to clients obtained by the ABC on Friday. ""It may prove a political noose at the subsequent election. $10 per gigajoule will not sustain gas investment."" Mr Kavonic said the Coalition's policy would reduce investment in domestic supply capacity to the point that ""breaking export contracts or gas shortages will be the inevitable result"". Mr Dutton used his budget reply speech on Thursday to announce he would seek to drive down household and business energy costs by forcing gas giants to set aside for local use up to 20 per cent of their production that would otherwise be destined for offshore markets. The move left many gas industry players stunned, but won support from others, including Santos, which may benefit from Mr Dutton's promise to earmark $1 billion for energy infrastructure, including pipelines near its Narrabri project. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Santos, which admitted it does not have any uncontracted gas available to the east coast market, said a reservation would provide certainty to the market and regional partners ""who rely on Australia for their energy security"". Opposition Leader Peter Dutton vows to ""immediately"" force gas giants to set aside for domestic use as much as 20 per cent of supply that would ""otherwise be exported"", cutting wholesale prices by 40 per cent. ""As outlined by the opposition, a reservation policy should only be applied to uncontracted gas,"" the company said in a statement. Gas industry lobby group Australian Energy Producers criticised Mr Dutton's plan as a misfire that would lead to a ""glut of gas"" that would deter investment in new supply and hurt Australia's trading relationships. Asked about AEP's criticism and predictions of an oversupply on the east coast, Mr Dutton gleefully replied: ""Well, that's good — and it'll bring down prices. ""That's exactly what we want to do. ""I'm not here to argue for the gas companies, I'm here to argue for Australian consumers — for mums and dads, for small businesses. ""We have a plan which will roll out certainty around supply, and we do need more supply."" Mr Dutton said the Coalition's plan would capture between 50 and 100 petajoules of gas headed for offshore cargo ships, to be diverted into domestic pipelines, driving prices down from $14 per gigajoule to $10 per gigajoule. The domestic market currently uses around 550 petajoules a year. The Coalition policy, foreshadowed by the ABC on Tuesday, is set to become a major talking point during the campaign, and has put Mr Dutton on a similar page to some green groups and independents like ACT senator David Pocock who back a domestic reservation. Independent Senator David Pocock backs a domestic gas reservation. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) It has long been seen as a bridge too far, with former ministers including Josh Frydenberg condemning the idea as a jobs and gas supply killer. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has delivered his response to the government's budget and it's big on petrol and gas, with barely a word on nuclear. Labor has not rushed to follow the Coalition's idea, and is understood to be weighing up the industry's reactions and concerns about unintended consequences. ""We've secured enough gas into the system over the next few years through the gas code of conduct,"" said Resources Minister Madeleine King.  ""Rather than forcing them to sell, and I don't know how you do that, we talk to them to secure the supply. It's not ideal but it works."" The Australian Workers Union urged Labor to consider an even more ambitious version than Mr Dutton's ""hoax"". ""A genuine reservation scheme could include gas from new and expanded fields, as well as gas purchased by LNG exporters from our domestic market instead of producing it themselves,"" said AWU national secretary Paul Farrow. ""It could also extend to cover long-term export contracts as they expire from 2031 onwards. This is the good faith policy that Labor should now advance."" Environmental, climate action and clean energy groups have reacted with dismay to Mr Dutton's policy, which they say will deepen Australia's reliance on fossil fuels rather than switching the country to renewables. David Close, director of the University of Queensland Gas and Energy Transition Research Centre, said he was ""aghast that the party of the free market has fallen victim to poorly conceived ideas"". ""It couldn't have been fully thought through,"" he said. Professor Close said the Coalition was making a similar mistake to Labor's late 2022 decision to legislate a $12 per gigajoule price cap on gas, which led to a freeze on new gas production investment. While Mr Dutton's plan would no doubt drive down prices in the short-term, he said the medium- to long-term consequences were negative. He noted that the Queensland gas industry spends around $4 billion a year just to keep production levels flat. ""As soon as that amount of investment starts to decline because any of those operators thinks their capital is best deployed internationally, the death spiral starts."" Grattan Institute energy director Tony Wood said the policy had ""superficial appeal"" since there was currently not enough gas to meet the needs of the east market, leading to ""unacceptably high"" gas and electricity prices. Grattan's Tony Wood said the policy had a worthy aim but was light on detail. (ABC News: Sean Warren) ""However, the opposition has not explained what the process would be and how it would work in practice. And over-supplied markets do not tend to remain that way,"" he said. ""It would surely be easier just to place an obligation on the LNG producers to contract ahead to meet the projected demand at a price no higher than whatever is considered a fair price."" Mr Kavonic, who this month wrote a column in The Australian calling on Ms King to resign over her gas industry ""code of conduct"", on Friday described Mr Dutton's policy as a ""betrayal of what the Coalition is supposed to stand for and has said about gas for the last three years"". ""It repeats the same mistakes that the Coalition has criticised Labor for over its gas code since 2022, and will have many of the same unintended consequences"". ""The risk is the policy could work politically near term, but leaves a terrible economic outcome medium/longer term,"" he said. He added that the Coalition's policy will further embolden independent and Green MPs to ""hit the sector harder"" if they hold the balance of power after the election. ""The industry invited this outcome (we have warned for years) and needs a rethink of its political campaigning failures in the wake of this,"" he said.

"All eyes on Brisbane as Labor, Liberal and Greens campaigns converge","Labor, Liberal and Greens leaders all begin in Brisbane as campaign kicks off in earnest",2025-03-29 13:13:55,"Anthony Albanese has started his election campaign on the offensive in his opponent Peter Dutton's electorate, declaring that Labor is ""out to win seats"". Labor, the Coalition and the Greens all started the race in Brisbane, where the major parties are locked in a tight battle to regain the inner-city seats they lost to the minor party three years ago. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Appearing alongside Treasurer Jim Chalmers, Health Minister Mark Butler and local Labor candidate Ali France at a Medicare clinic in Dickson — the Coalition leader's seat — Mr Albanese told reporters the location was chosen ""because it's the most marginal seat in Brisbane"". ""I'm out to win seats, I'm out to win here … I want a majority Labor government,"" he said. Anthony Albanese kicked of his election campaign proper with a media conference at a Medicare clinic in Peter Dutton's electorate. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) The prime minister used the media conference to take swings at the opposition, describing Labor as ""competent and considered"" while painting the Coalition as ""chaotic and dysfunctional"".  ""This campaign isn't just about me versus Peter Dutton. I'm humble enough to know that it's also about our team,"" he said.  Pointing to the cabinet members flanking him, Mr Albanese drew comparisons to their opposition counterparts. ""Their team, you look at them — they are not ready for government,"" he said. Brisbane resident Peter Dutton spent the first day of the campaign in his rain-drenched home city after a launch there on Friday morning and is expected to remain there on Saturday. Peter Dutton speaks to journalists on first day of campaigning. There was a brief crossover between the Coalition leader and Mr Albanese's campaign on Saturday morning, where he took questions from journalists travelling with the prime minister. Asked if he was the underdog going into the race, he said there hadn't been a change of a first term government since 1931.  ""But our job is to make sure we talk to Australians about our positive plan for our country."" Appearing on breakfast TV earlier in the morning, the Coalition leader spruiked his gas reservation policy while disputing assertions that the Coalition's nuclear power plan had been put on the backburner.  Pressed on when the changes to the gas industry would result in lower power bills for Australians, he said ""by the end of this year, this calendar year, we can bring that gas into the system"". ""It doesn't require any infrastructure. It's a matter of turning it back into the economy,"" he said. Greens leader Adam Bandt also appeared in the city that delivered his party a landmark breakthrough at the 2022 election, when it won the seat of Griffith from Labor and the seats of Brisbane and Ryan from the Coalition. The early convergence on the Queensland capital puts a spotlight on the role of the crossbench in an election where the major party vote share is tipped to fall to a record low and a hung parliament — where no party wins a majority of seats — is firmly in view. That prospect was put to Mr Albanese in the very first question of his Friday morning press conference, where he insisted his intention was to ""lead a majority government"" and refused to discuss the alternative. With marginal seats everywhere and a range of third party challenges, there are plenty of storylines to watch. Mr Dutton has often mentioned of the possibility of a Labor minority government supported by Greens and teals, which he says would be ""chaotic"", hoping to remind voters of a similar parliament in 2010 which, though it saw a lot of legislation passed, ended in the heavy defeat of the Gillard Labor government. ""An Albanese-Bandt Labor-Greens government … would be a disaster for the economy and families and small business. We can provide certainty and stability to get our country back on track, and that's what we intend to do,"" he said earlier this week. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Scarred by the experience of the 2010 parliament, Labor would almost certainly avoid the sort of formal agreement it opted for last time, a model the current crossbench seems reluctant to embrace whichever side it negotiates with. For their part, the Greens' focus will be squarely on Mr Dutton, which party sources say reflects animosity campaigners have encountered towards the Coalition leader among inner-city voters. ""Voting Greens across Brisbane is the way to stop Peter Dutton,"" Mr Bandt suggested on Friday. ""Peter Dutton is bringing Trump-style politics to Australia, and the Greens will stop him."" While the Greens are confident they can retain all three seats, sources from all three parties suggest the high-profile Max Chandler-Mather is best placed, with Labor a strong chance in Brisbane and the Coalition in Ryan. All three parties received at least 20 per cent of the vote in all three seats in 2022. The three parties diverge sharply on the important election issue of housing, likely to resonate strongly with young renters in inner-city electorates. Nearly half of voters in the seats of Brisbane and Griffith are renters, a proportion well above the national average, while Ryan is also slightly above average. Peter Dutton has linked the housing crisis to elevated migration, promising to cut the permanent migrant intake by 25 per cent. Keep up with all the major commitments promised by Labor and the Coalition as they campaign for Australia's vote. In his budget reply speech on Thursday night, he confirmed that if elected, he would allow first home buyers to withdraw up to $50,000 from their superannuation for a home deposit and put ""stricter caps on foreign students to relieve stress on rental markets"". Labor recently extended its Help to Buy housing program, which allows a limited number of first home buyers to co-purchase a home with the government, based on similar schemes that already exist at state and territory level. It has also set up an investment fund to support the construction of social and affordable housing, which the Coalition has vowed to scrap. The Greens advocate for rent caps and for the government to build and sell houses. The seats to watch in the 2025 federal election.

"Experts poke holes in Peter Dutton's gas plan, saying 'the horse has bolted'",More gas and lower prices 'years away' as experts poke holes in Coalition's gas reservation policy,2025-03-28 17:03:43,"In the febrile environment of a federal election campaign, an uneasy consensus seems to have emerged between the major parties on an unlikely topic — the gas industry. Or, more specifically, the shortcomings of the gas industry in Australia and the need to bring it to heel. On Thursday night, as foreshadowed by the ABC's Jacob Greber, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said he would impose a reservation policy of sorts on east coast gas if elected prime minister. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail The aim, he put it simply, was to force more gas through the domestic market and bring prices down ""from over $14 per gigajoule to under $10 per gigajoule"". ""This is just the start,"" Mr Dutton told parliament in his reply to this week's budget. But no sooner had the words left Mr Dutton's mouth than industry experts from across the economic and political spectrum were piling on to poke holes in what they said would be a flawed and counterproductive policy. Some questioned whether the opposition leader had the gumption to stare down the gas industry. Others accused the Coalition of hypocrisy — of attacking Federal Labor for its attempts at regulation while proposing a radical and ""anti-market"" intervention of its own. For Mark Hanna, a veteran of Western Australia's liquefied natural gas industry, the problem with Mr Dutton's plan was more prosaic. Mr Hanna said it was likely to be too little, too late. He said the time to play hardball with the likes of gas companies was before their projects were developed. This was the scenario in which former WA premier Alan Carpenter jawboned gas firms into accepting that state's domestic gas reservation policy in 2007, Mr Hanna said. But he noted that the Eastern States' gas export industry — courtesy of three huge LNG projects near Gladstone in Queensland — had already been operating for a decade. The APLNG project at Gladstone, Queensland. (Supplied: APLNG) Yet, because of decisions taken by state and federal governments of both stripes, he said no reservation policy of note had ever been implemented. Meanwhile, an eastern Australian domestic gas market that had long enjoyed prices of just a few dollars a gigajoule had been exposed to much higher international prices. So much so, in fact, they have been trading about $15 a gigajoule for the past year. ""The government used to have a lot more leverage because all of these companies were looking to build new projects,"" he said. ""And so therefore, they would come to the party and help out even if they felt they didn't really want to. ""But because there's no future projects, I'm not sure they'd be really bending over backwards to help."" Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Under the details of the Coalition's policy announced so far, gas exporters on the east coast would be required to provide an extra 50 to 100 petajoules a year for the domestic market. Local customers in eastern Australia currently use about 500 petajoules of gas a year, according to the Australian Energy Regulator. Much more gas, however, is exported, with about 1300 petajoules sent overseas last year, most of which was tied up in long-term contracts with customers in Asia. One petajoule of gas is equivalent to the energy used by 19,000 homes in a year. Tim Buckley, the founder and director of the public interest think tank Climate Energy Finance, said the Coalition's plans appeared attractive in theory. Mr Buckley said ""the idea of getting"" more gas to Australian consumers at a fair and reasonable price was a laudable one. Not only would it reduce the costs to households and businesses using the fuel directly for heating, cooking, or manufacturing, he said, it would help ease power prices. He said this was because gas still played an outsized role in setting electricity prices, noting that at least some gas was almost invariably needed to meet peaks in demand. Gas consumption in Australia is falling faster than anticipated, helping to avoid the risks of seasonal shortages in the next few years, according to energy commentators. Despite this, Mr Buckley doubted the Coalition would have the wherewithal to ram through changes that were so obviously against the interests of the gas industry and likely to be bitterly opposed by it. ""The devil is always in the detail,"" Mr Buckley told the ABC's RN Breakfast program. ""In theory, it sounds good, but there will be a major quid pro quo. ""We know that the multinational gas cartel — and that's what they are, they're a cartel that's been extracting monopoly rents from Australian consumers, gas consumers, for a decade. ""I don't think they're going to just give up their cartel behaviour because Peter Dutton says it."" Mr Buckley also said the notion — put forward by Mr Dutton — that the Coalition could quickly lower gas prices by streamlining the development of new fields was fanciful. As part of its pitch, the opposition said it would clear the way for new gas supplies by fast-tracking approvals, defunding the Environmental Defenders Office and enforcing ""use-it-or-lose-it"" provisions for offshore fields. Peter Dutton's pledge to approve a major WA gas project within 30 days of taking office could pose legal challenges. (ABC Pilbara: Charlie Mclean) But Mr Buckley argued it was disingenuous to suggest more gas could be brought online virtually overnight. More likely, he said, it would take years, even allowing for the Coalition's friendlier policies. As an example, he pointed to Santos's troubled Narrabri project in northern New South Wales. He said the project had been on the drawing board for more than a decade and had not been developed even though domestic gas prices had reached unprecedented heights in recent years. ""[Mr Dutton] says categorically it's about ramping up domestic gas production,"" he said. Santos's Narrabri gas project in northern NSW has met with fierce opposition. (ABC News: Chris Gillette) Saul Kavonic, the head of energy research at MST Marquee, was even more strident. Mr Kavonic said the Coalition's policy was base politics that would eventually backfire on the Liberal and National Parties, energy users and the economy as a whole. He said that although the policy ""may be popular"", at least in the short term, it was in his view bound to ultimately fail. According to Mr Kavonic, this was because the Coalition's position was fatally confused and conflicted. On the one hand, he said Mr Dutton was telling the gas industry to invest. But on the other hand, he said the opposition leader was advocating changes that would undermine or even kill the business case for many proposed gas projects. He noted Mr Dutton had been explicit in targeting domestic gas prices that were lower than $10 a gigajoule. ""Once you say we're effectively going to cap the price at $10, there's a lot of supply projects that were going to come online that won't work at $10,"" Mr Kavonic said. In a withering assessment of the plan, Mr Kavonic said: ""The Coalition has proven a weak, populist hypocrite on gas."" Saul Kavonic says the Coalition's plans are ultimately bound to backfire. (ABC News: John Gunn) While equally critical of the Albanese government's intervention in the gas market in 2022, when it tried to introduce price caps, Mr Kavonic said the measures were at least taken at a time of crisis. But he argued the Coalition's proposal was arguably worse given its previous criticism of Labor's move and its seemingly calculated nature. Ultimately, Mr Kavonic said the burden of any Coalition reservation policy would fall on just two suppliers — the Queensland Curtis LNG plant operated by Shell and the Australia Pacific project run by Origin. He said it was those two projects that were responsible for exporting virtually all of the additional cargoes from the east coast that were not locked up in long-term contracts — a figure amounting to about 300 petajoules last year. By contrast, he said Santos's Gladstone LNG project would avoid the fallout — at least for a while — even though it had arguably done more than any other to hoover up spare domestic gas supplies and push up prices in recent years. Queensland's Curtis LNG plant, operated by Shell, could bear the brunt of any gas reservation rules. (Supplied: Photopia Studio) ""What will happen over time is the amount of gas you need for them to divert domestically to keep the price down will increase,"" he said.

It is perhaps ironic, given they spend almost half their time there, but the campaign trail tends to lead anywhere but the nation's capital. That is unlikely to change this year; in the race to 76 seats, Labor's prospects in all three ACT electorates still look pretty good.

That is up 41,411 from the average in the 2021-22 financial year, the last year of the Morrison government. But not all of the new public servants actually work in Canberra.

(ABC News: Ian Cutmore) As of 30 June last year, only 36.9 per cent of the workforce — or 68,435 — was based in the capital. The ABC has asked Mr Dutton's office whether he intends to make all of the proposed cutbacks from Canberra. The morning after the budget, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said the cuts would be achieved through a hiring freeze. ACT Labor Senator Katy Gallagher says it's clear the Coalition wants to ""point the finger"" at Canberra public servants.  (ABC News: David Sciasci) The ACT's two senators have jumped immediately on Peter Dutton's line. Labor's Katy Gallagher, herself the Public Service Minister, said there was ""an element of Canberra bashing"" in the opposition's plans.

An electorate, also known as a seat, is made up of around 110,000 voters living in the same area, so you — and everyone you live near — get to select a local member to represent you. There's going to be 150 of them in the lower house in the next parliament — one for each electorate in the country. This is important because whoever wins a majority of the seats in the lower house gets to form government. Or, if they don't get enough on their own, whoever strikes an agreement with independents and minor parties to make up the numbers can form a minority government. Who you vote for will depend on which federal electorate you're in.  Your federal electorate has a different name to your state electorate.  This AEC website will tell you what electorate you're in.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page, enter your suburb, locality or postcode and hit the purple ""find"" button.  Throughout the campaign we'll be covering who the parties and independents are, what they stand for and other key policies as part of our series Politics Explained.

"Tasmania's state of play: the toss-up seat, the minister's challenge, and Labor's long shot","Tasmania's state of play for the federal election: the toss-up seat, the long shots, and the minister's challenge",2025-03-30 09:23:03,"It's historically difficult for election analysts to predict what will happen in Tasmania at each federal election, particularly in its three northern seats. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Often, one or two swinging seats are too close to call, or a sitting MP clings on when they're expected to lose. Anthony Albanese (right) at a Tasmanian salmon processing facility. (X: Anthony Albanese) Peter Dutton (centre) at a Tasmanian salmon processing facility. (ABC News: Jano Gibson) What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. But despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's frequent visits to Tasmania, political analysts don't expect many seats to change hands this time around. Both ABC election analyst Antony Green and psephologist Dr Kevin Bonham think Lyons, held by Labor by just 0.9 per cent, is by far the most interesting seat. Held by retiring Labor MP Brian Mitchell, both agree the preselection of former state opposition leader Rebecca White boosts the party's chances of hanging on, but say the government's vulnerable if there's a swing away from it and towards Opposition Leader Peter Dutton. Labor is relying on Rebecca White's previous strong results in the state seat of Lyons to help the party retain the federal seat. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) Ms White has traditionally polled strongly in the state seat of Lyons, which shares the same boundaries as the federal seat. ""I think she will improve on the performance they had there last time, but can she overcome if there's any swing against the government?"" Mr Green said. Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone chief executive Susie Bower, who narrowly lost the seat in 2022 to Mr Mitchell, is again contesting Lyons for the Liberals. The ABC is asking you to be part of the conversation this election. (ABC News) ""Because of what happened with Mitchell the previous election [the margin narrowing and negative media coverage of historic social media posts] there was a sense that she might get in this time, but it is a different thing now,"" Dr Bonham said. Both experts say they're also keeping at least half an eye on Braddon, where incumbent Liberal MP Gavin Pearce's retirement means Labor fancies its chances of winning the seat back, despite an 8 per cent margin. Senator Anne Urquhart is running in the lower house seat of Braddon, hoping to bridge the Liberals' 8 per cent margin. (ABC News: Sandy Powell) Labor has preselected Senator Anne Urquhart as its candidate, and has managed to introduce new legislation to ensure salmon farming can continue in Macquarie Harbour, in a bid to keep locals on side. But both experts say Labor's poor state election results in Braddon (it recorded a primary vote of 24.7 per cent) mean it's a huge hill to climb, and are sceptical that Senator Urquhart has a high enough profile to narrow the gap. Despite a much lower margin of 1.4 per cent in Bass, both experts expect Liberal MP Bridget Archer to win her way to a third term. And they say Independent Andrew Wilkie is odds-on to win again in Clark, which he holds by a 20.8 per cent margin. There's another double-digit margin in Franklin, held by Labor minister Julie Collins on a margin of 13.7 per cent. Peter George has been a prominent anti-salmon farm campaigner in Tasmania's south-east, but Labor holds Franklin by a significant margin. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) Tasmania's aquaculture industry has well and truly rocketed to prominence, with even Hollywood actors weighing in. Dr Bonham says the addition of two independent candidates — anti-salmon farm campaigner Peter George and Clarence Mayor and former Liberal member Brendan Blomeley — make the contest more interesting than it would otherwise have been. But he says the federal government would need to be extremely on the nose with voters for Ms Collins to lose. It points to an election campaign featuring just a few fleeting visits from Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton to Tasmania, to either the northern or southern end of the Lyons electorate, plus maybe a quick pop-in to Braddon. But with polling showing both parties have their work cut out to govern in majority, the battle for votes in the island state is still expected to be fierce. Where is it? Bass comprises the city of Launceston, and Tasmania's north-east corner. Towns of note include George Town, Scottsdale and Bridport. It also includes the Furneaux Group of Islands in Bass Strait, including Flinders and Cape Barren islands. Launceston is the main population centre in Bass. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) Who holds it? Bridget Archer, Liberal Party (1.4 per cent margin) Who else is running? Teacher Jess Teesdale is running for Labor, while family lawyer Charlene McLennan has been preselected for the Greens. Fun facts: The seat is named after George Bass, the first European to discover that a strait (later named Bass Strait in his honour) separated Tasmania from the mainland. ABC election analyst Antony Green calls Bass an ""ejector seat"", with just two sitting MPs (Labor's Michelle O'Byrne and incumbent Bridget Archer) re-elected for a second term at the last 12 federal elections. Prediction: Despite the close margin, both psephologist Kevin Bonham and ABC election analyst Antony Green say it's likely Ms Archer holds on to the seat. Dr Bonham says it ""will take a phenomenal effort from Labor to win Bass"", and its lateness in preselecting Ms Teesdale indicates the party doesn't have huge hopes of doing so. Mr Green says it would be a ""surprise"" to see Ms Archer lose after hanging on to the seat three years ago, despite a national swing against the Liberals. Where is it? Braddon covers Tasmania's north-west and west coast, plus King Island. It includes Burnie, Ulverstone, Devonport, Smithton and Stanley, plus Rosebery, Strahan and Queenstown. Salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour has been the topic of fierce political debate. The harbour, and nearby towns of Strahan and Queenstown, are in Braddon. (Bob Brown Foundation) Who holds it? Gavin Pearce, Liberal Party (8 per cent). Mr Pearce is retiring at the federal election. Who's running? Defence contractor Mal Hingston is running for the Liberals, while Labor Senator Anne Urquhart is hoping to switch houses of parliament. Health care worker Erin Morrow will run for the Greens, while former builder and farmer Adam Martin is contesting as an independent. Fun facts: Largely a Liberal-stronghold from its inception in 1955 until the mid-1990s, it's been a swing seat ever since, with Labor winning the seat at six of the last 10 elections. The electorate is named after former Tasmanian premier George Edward Braddon. Prediction: Mr Green says Labor's low vote in Braddon at previous elections means winning back the seat would be a big hill to climb. Dr Bonham says the battle is closer than the 8 per cent margin indicates given Mr Pearce's retirement, but he says Braddon's demographics mean it's a difficult seat for Labor to win. Where is it? Clark takes in the Hobart CBD and suburbs including Sandy Bay, West Hobart, New Town, Moonah and Glenorchy, ending just shy of the construction site at the Bridgewater Bridge. Clark, which centres on Hobart, is one of Australia's safest seats in terms of margin. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) Who holds it? Andrew Wilkie, Independent (20.8 per cent margin) Who else is running? The Liberals have preselected fashion designer Marilena Di Florio, while the Greens have locked in public servant Janet Shelley. The Labor Party announced staffer Heidi Heck as its candidate after the election campaign got underway. Fun facts: Formerly called Denison, it was renamed in 2017 in honour of Andrew Inglis Clark, the co-founder of the Australian Constitution who popularised the Hare-Clark voting system and brought it to Tasmania. Independent Andrew Wilkie has held the seat since 2010, and is vying for a sixth term. It's an electorate that tends to be won by the same MP for long stretches, with just three politicians (Mr Wilkie, Labor's Duncan Kerr and Liberal Michael Hodgman) holding it in the past 50 years. Prediction: Both experts say they expect Mr Wilkie to win easily. Dr Bonham says he doesn't think Mr Wilkie will have any difficulty, while Mr Green says Mr Wilkie ""is safe there until he chooses to retire"". Where is it? Franklin takes in a swathe of Hobart's eastern suburbs, including Bellerive, Risdon Vale, Lauderdale and Lindisfarne. It also includes suburbs south of Hobart, such as Kingston, and regional areas further south in the Huon Valley. Franklin takes in the Huon Valley, in Tasmania's far south. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) Who holds it? Julie Collins, Labor Party (13.7 per cent margin) Who else is running? Anti-fish farm campaigner Peter George and former Liberal member and Clarence mayor Brendan Blomeley are both running as independents. Former political staffer Josh Garvin is the Liberal candidate, while teenage political advisor Owen Fitzgerald is running for the Greens. Fun facts: The seat has been won by Labor at the past 11 elections (including six wins by incumbent Julie Collins). But before that, it was held by Liberal MP Bruce Goodluck, who once wore a chicken suit into the House of Representatives as a dare. It's named after former Tasmanian lieutenant-governor Sir John Franklin, who died in the Canadian Arctic while on an expedition in search of the north-west passage. Prediction: Mr Green says he doesn't expect Ms Collins to lose the seat. Dr Bonham says the number of independents running means he'll keep an eye on the seat. but ""it's not easy to see Julie Collins being beaten"". Where is it? Tasmania's largest electorate geographically, Lyons takes in just under half of the state. It includes all of the towns on the east coast, the Central Highlands, larger southern towns including Richmond, Sorell, Bridgewater and New Norfolk, and towns south and west of Launceston such as Longford, Cressy, Westbury and Deloraine. Lyons takes in Tasmania's picturesque east coast, farming towns in the midlands, Launceston's outer southern suburbs, and Hobart's outer northern suburbs. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) Who holds it? Brian Mitchell, Labor Party (0.9 per cent). Mr Mitchell is retiring at the federal election. Who is running? Former state opposition leader Rebecca White is running for Labor, while Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone chief executive Susie Bower is again running for the Liberals after narrowly losing in 2022. Bob Brown Foundation campaigner Alistair Allan is the Greens' candidate, and veterinarian Angela Offord is running as an independent. Fun facts: Lyons was called Wilmot until 1984, but renamed in honour of former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, and his wife Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives. The electorate tends to be held by MPs for long periods, with Labor's Gil Duthie, Liberal Max Burr and Labor's Dick Adams all holding it for at least 15 years. That trend ended when Liberal MP Eric Hutchinson lasted just one term before being defeated by incumbent Brian Mitchell in 2016. Prediction: Both experts say this is the seat they're most interested in. Dr Bonham says Ms White's preselection is a ""big plus"" given the strong personal vote she's received at state elections, but the party is still vulnerable if voters decide to kick out the government. Mr Green agrees Ms White makes it easier for Labor but says it's difficult to predict if she's able to overcome a swing against her party or Mr Albanese. Senators up for re-election: Richard Colbeck and Claire Chandler (Liberal), Carol Brown (Labor), Jacqui Lambie (Jacqui Lambie Network), Nick McKim (Greens) Retiring: Catryna Bilyk (Labor) Prediction: Dr Bonham says the Senate make-up (of two Liberals, two from the ALP, a Green and Senator Lambie) is extremely unlikely to change at this election, barring a huge change in the vote. Labor has preselected economist and former advisor Richard Dowling at number two on its ticket to replace Senator Bilyk. Your Say: What issues are on your mind ahead of the election?

"The race is on: Election campaign to be fought on cost of living, energy","Campaign kicks off ahead of May 3 federal election, with lines drawn on cost of living and energy",2025-03-28 15:29:07,"Anthony Albanese has officially called the federal election for May 3, kicking off a five-week race that will see him go head-to-head with Peter Dutton in a battle for Australia's leadership.  Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail The prime minister travelled to Government House at dawn on Friday to officially dissolve parliament, just days after the government handed down its fourth federal budget. At a media conference at Parliament House a short time later, Mr Albanese told Australians that their ""vote has never been more important"". ""What I want is a campaign about policy substance and about hope and optimism for our country. I'm optimistic about Australia,"" he said. ""This election is a choice between Labor's plan to keep building or Peter Dutton's promise to cut. That is the choice. That is your choice."" Australia will go to the polls on May 3, after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese officially called the election. (AAP: Mick Tsikas) Opposition Leader Peter Dutton set up a contrasting choice when he addressed voters from Brisbane less than 24 hours after delivering his budget reply speech, asking Australians to consider ""who can better manage the economy"".  ""Generations of Australians have built their lives and our country on the belief that if you work hard you can get ahead and build a better future for your children. However, right now, Australia is going backwards,"" he said.  ""I don't believe that we can simply afford to continue down the current path and that means that we can't afford three more years of Labor."" With the cost-of-living crisis still front of mind for many Australians, and little time for the Reserve Bank's first interest rate cut in years to be truly felt by voters, both sides go into the race spruiking policies they claim will help ease hip-pocket pain without fanning inflation. Peter Dutton pitched the election as a choice over who can better manage the economy.  (ABC News: Lucas Hill) Labor's pitch includes a ""modest"" tax cut for every worker, cheaper doctor's visits off the back of a $8.5 billion boost to Medicare, lower-cost medicines and student debt relief, while Mr Dutton's Coalition has vowed to introduce a gas reservation policy, clean up ""waste"" in the public service, halve the fuel excise for a year and build a nuclear energy network they say will lower power bills.  The opposition has also promised to match many of Labor's election commitments. Those policies will be debated against a backdrop of growing instability across the globe, with the spectre of further tariffs under the Trump Administration, wars in the Middle East and Europe, and the ongoing threat of China raising the stakes for any incoming government. Decisions outside the candidates' control could mean a bumpy start to the campaign, with the Reserve Bank due to make an another interest rate decision early next week and US President Donald Trump expected to announce another round of global tariffs days later. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. The battle is set to be tight, with Labor only three seats away from losing their majority and the Coalition needing to gain 19 seats to form government in their own right. If that eventuated, it would make Albanese's Labor the first one-term government in close to a century. Labor's slim margin means a hung parliament led by whichever party can secure the support of the crossbench is a distinct possibility, something that has happened only twice in Australia's history. Climate 200 — the cashed-up campaign group that backed the wave of ""teal"" independents in 2022 — is once again supporting dozens of candidates in mostly Coalition seats, hoping to build on the record 19 independents and minor party candidates elected to the House of Representatives at the last election. But it's likely the election will largely be fought in outer-suburban and regional electorates where Labor and the Coalition will go head to head. Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton will battle each other to convince voters they should lead the country for the next three years.  (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) Mr Albanese's re-election efforts have so far focused on traditional Labor policy areas, like health, education and childcare, in a bid to win over families and young people. This week's budget also included a surprise income tax cut, which would leave the average worker with an extra $268 when it kicks in halfway through 2026 and $536 each year after that. If re-elected, the party plans to expand the bulk-billing incentive and offer a new bonus for doctors that exclusively bulk-bill, at a cost of $8.5 billion — changes the government claims will mean nine out of 10 GP visits are free by the end of the decade.  The prime minister travelled to Government House at dawn on Friday to formally dissolve parliament. (AAP: Lukas Coch) A further $644 million has been earmarked to build more urgent care clinics, $690 million to cap the cost of medicines on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at $25, and $573 million to fund Medicare rebates for long-acting contraceptives, like IUDs. Beyond health, Labor is also promising 100,000 fee-free TAFE places each year from 2027, to wipe 20 per cent off HECS-HELP debts, and to increase the income threshold for those loan repayments.  Another $1 billion will be poured into a fund to build and support new early education services. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage In a sign of how close the race is and seeking to fend off another ""Mediscare"" campaign, the Coalition vowed to match Labor's headline Medicare policy just hours after the prime minister announced it, touting an additional $500 million to bolster mental health services. Mr Dutton has also flexed plans to shrink the public service by 41,000 positions to reduce bureaucratic ""waste"" and to force government workers back into the office, echoing President Trump's focus on ""government efficiency"".  Patricia Karvelas brings you authoritative and timely coverage of the latest political news. Hear the Politics Now podcast on ABC listen. Rejecting Labor's income tax cuts, the opposition instead announced plans to cut the fuel excise from 50 cents to 25 cents for a year immediately if they are elected — a $6 billion move they say will save families hundreds of dollars a year. He has also promised a $400 million investment in youth mental health, a boost for small businesses in the form of tax-deductible lunches and tough-on crime policies, including stronger and more uniform laws for knife offences. The headline announcement in Mr Dutton's budget reply speech on Thursday night was a promise to force gas giants to set aside as much as 20 per cent of supply for domestic use, a plan he said would cut wholesale prices by 40 per cent, along with a $1 billion pledge to expand the east coast market. Peter Dutton used his budget reply speech to announce the Coalition's gas plan. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Meanwhile, nuclear power remains one of the key policy differences between the two parties, with the Coalition planning to build new nuclear reactors on seven sites to supplement the transition away from coal-fired power — an approach they claim will be cheaper than Labor's renewables-heavy roadmap to net zero. That proposal has come under fire from top economists who argue it will end up being more expensive and burn more carbon than the Coalition's modelling suggests.  Labor will extend its energy bill relief scheme until the end of the year, a move the Coalition has agreed to match, meaning an extra $150 in rebates for households. But the government is yet to make any new commitments specifically targeted at bringing down power prices next term, banking on its renewable plan being cheaper in the long run.  David Speers presents Australia's must-watch political program, joined by a panel of the best political analysts and commentators. Stream now on ABC iview. When it comes to other key election issues, like housing and migration, the major parties are more in line. Both Labor and the Coalition have said increasing supply is the solution to the housing crisis, but they differ on their approach.  Mr Dutton has bet on more construction in greenfield urban fringe zones, by promising funding for infrastructure like water, power, sewerage and roads. He has also said they would allow first home buyers to dip into their super to get on the property ladder. Conversely, Labor has led a push for state-based planning reform to allow for higher-density developments in cities as part of a bid to reach their national construction target of 1.2 million homes in five years. Anthony Albanese so far focused his pitch on traditional Labor policy areas, like health, education and childcare. (ABC News: Ethan Rix) Both parties have also vowed to stem the flood of temporary migrants arriving since the reopening of COVID border closures. The Coalition has promised to reduce the permanent migration program by 25 per cent — from 185,000 to 140,000 — for two years, before raising it slightly in subsequent years. Labor had tried to implement caps on the number of international students able to start study in Australia each year as their main mechanism to drive down migration, but was thwarted when the Coalition joined the Greens to block the bill. The Coalition has committed to even stronger international student caps if they are elected. Labor goes into the contest nominally with 78 seats in the House of Representatives and the Coalition with 57, using ABC election analyst Antony Green's revised electoral pendulum. Labor's power base is currently in the cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide, with the Coalition keen to target the outer-suburban ""mortgage belt"" to make up the difference.  But if both parties fail to win the requisite 76 seats, which appears to be a likely possibility, they will need to negotiate with the crossbench to form government. Australians could head to the polls in a federal election within months. So when will it be and what are the key seats in the battle to lead the country? Minor parties and independents currently hold 19 seats in the House of Representatives — the highest number since the two-party system was established more than a century ago. Only two independents have explicitly said they would be open to striking formal governing arrangements in the event of a hung parliament, setting up the prospect that the next government could have to negotiate bill-by-bill.  At the last election, a record 27 seats ended up in contests that weren't the traditional Labor versus Coalition race. The electoral map has shifted since then as a result of by-elections, defections and redistributions in three states. North Sydney, currently held by ""teal"" independent Kylea Tink, and Higgins in Victoria, won by Labor's Michelle Ananda-Rajah at the last election, have been abolished. A new seat of Bullwinkel has been created in Western Australia. More than half the seats in the House of Representatives will also be fought on new electoral boundaries.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-28/federal-election-2025-campaign-may-3/104750332
Dutton's latest barrage in Coalition's 25-year war with itself on fuel excise,"Peter Dutton's budget reply is big on gas and petrol, as a sellable excise cut beats the Coalition's war with itself",2025-03-28 10:34:54,"Election 2025: Opening sequence. Peter Dutton stands on a Canberra roadside, wearing a ""Cheap Fuel Now! Ask Me How!"" sandwich board, as a Yarralumla-bound Anthony Albanese fangs past in his armoured BMW 7 Series, obscuring the opposition leader in a cloud of prime ministerial exhaust. LIVE UPDATES: Get the latest news from the federal election campaign trail as it happens LIVE UPDATES: Get the latest news from the federal election campaign trail as it happens Welcome to Democracy 2025: Revenge Of The Opportunists. Yes: After months of careful thought and much high-minded talk of responsible economic management and the sombre task of fiscal repair, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has delivered his response to the government's budget and it turns out that the big idea at its core is the squirting of tax-reduced cheap petrol, directly into voters' vehicles, at a cost of $6 billion, for the period of one calendar year. The opposition says it would repeal Labor's legislated tax cuts and halve the fuel excise for a year. And in order to interrupt the pleasing thought of cheaper petrol, the PM is calling an election more or less immediately. To the budget reply first, because fair enough. A budget demands a reply, and the opposition leader's reply to this week's budget is to oppose its slender and already-legislated tax cuts, while halving the federal excise on petrol. Shorter version? 25c off the pump price! For a whole year! And after that, the opposition leader says, ""We'll review it"". More of that later. Peter Dutton's fuel excise cut to cost $6 billion, extends to heavy-vehicle road users As a measure, halving the federal tax on petrol is easy to explain in a pop-up ad. Easy to visualise. Keep in mind, the Dutton policy jukebox has been cranking out some pretty niche material of late: recent highlights include the rococo ""I Might Have Another Expensive Referendum So I Can Kick Out Terrorists (Or Maybe Also I Won't)"", and the hallucinogen-fuelled sitar epic ""I'm Building Nuclear Power Stations From Scratch In A Decade, So You Can Have 44 per cent Cheaper Power From Tomorrow"". The treasurer was all smiles on budget night, promising resilience in the face of global uncertainty.  Compared to these tunes, ""Cheaper Petrol! Who's With Me?"" feels kind of mainstream and danceable. Good policy? Well, no. It damages the budget bottom line. It will go to people who don't need it, as well as to people who do. You'd struggle to find an economist who'd defend the move. But this nation is largely composed of non-economists, and many of them are seriously stressed, financially. And when people are seriously struggling to make ends meet, this is a way to help that is direct, easily communicated, and — crucially — disappears after a year. If you have a problem with costly temporary measures that bugger up the budget bottom line and put money in the pockets of people who don't really need it, then for consistency you probably need to copy in ""Chalmers, Jim"" to the recipient field of your emailed protest to Mr Dutton, on account of the afore-mentioned gentleman's recent refreshment of the electricity bill handout. Merits of the petrol excise cut aside, the craven question is, will it work? Depends how you define success. It won't work to help return Australia to a sustainable budgetary situation, or to reduce carbon emissions. But it might well work to make people who do a lot of driving and live in areas with crappy public transport feel like someone is trying to help.  And that might well work to win votes for the man delivering the speech, and seeing as we can all agree, at this late stage, that this is at least a significant part of the driving idea, then the answer is: Yeah, possibly. It might. The federal budget includes a ""modest"" tax cut for every taxpayer, starting from next year. Mr Dutton's surprise decision to halve petrol excise is the latest episode in an absolutely fascinating 25-year argument the Liberal Party has been having … with itself. Who's winning? Too early to say. Let's recap. A quarter of a century ago, when the Howard government had just introduced the GST and were dealing with the resultant teething issues, petrol prices in Australia broke the sickening psychological barrier of (Gadzooks!!) ONE DOLLAR A LITRE. (For context, the current price of petrol in the stupidly-pricey city of Sydney sits at an average $1.81. Which is a lot. But it's less than it was at the peak, a year ago, when Sydney motorists paid up to $2.40). From mid-2000, John Howard and his treasurer Peter Costello were hammered mercilessly by motoring enthusiasts, twitchy backbenchers and tabloid newspapers to cut petrol taxes. The Daily Telegraph accused the pair of having their greedy hands in the nation's glovebox. In late 2000, the paper ran an iconic front page with a doctored image of the PM and treasurer wearing keffiyehs, under the headline: ""TAX SHEIKHS!!"" The Daily Telegraph's front page on August 23, 2000. (The Daily Telegraph) And for months on end, Howard and Costello explained that such a move would be foolish, ineffectual, damaging to the nation's economic interests, and generally a terrible idea. This was the consensus position until February 2001, when the electoral fortunes of the Coalition turned truly toxic, at which point Mr Howard called a press conference in Canberra and smoothly — shockingly — executed a full reversal.  Actually, a reversal-plus. Not only did the PM cut excise by 1.5c, but he froze the indexation of the tax, in what was — if tax policy can properly be described this way — an electrifying move. Did it work? Yes it did, in the sense that the Howard government's fortunes turned around soon after, and were notably on the improve before the arrival of the Tampa and the horror of September 11, which now give our memories of the 2001 election campaign their unmistakeable khaki hue. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage For more than a decade, federal excise remained frozen at 38c a litre. Why? Because while it's easy to cut petrol excise, and to generate excitement around the idea of cheaper petrol, it's rather stickier to increase it, even when budgetary principle suggests that might be the more prudent path. The budget — during the lengthy period that excise rates slumbered at 38c thanks to the enduring power of Mr Howard's enchantment — forwent many, many billions of dollars in tax revenue. No-one wanted to be the leader who made petrol more expensive again. Even Kevin Rudd — campaigning in 2007 with his avowed campaign affection for a mysterious Canberra-based lady called Budgetary Prudence — wouldn't touch the excise rate. No way. Instead, he promised a fuel price monitoring website called FuelWatch, which encountered all manner of bureaucratic entanglements and was put out for kerbside collection before it even got underway. In 2008, when opposition leader Brendan Nelson (who, like Mr Dutton, took the reins of what remained of the Liberal Party after a sickening federal election defeat) rose to give his budget reply to the Rudd government's first budget, he demanded that the excise be cut by a further 5c, to bring succour to motorists struggling at the bowser. Dr Nelson's 2008 budget reply remains a classic of the genre, a legendary primal scream in which he invoked voters ""lining up in their 20-year-old Mitsubishis … in their 10-year-old Commodores with three kids in the back … in their Taragos with a wheelchair in the back and five kids"". It's not a theatrical high in any way challenged by Mr Dutton's contribution in 2025. Did it work? Not really, as Dr Nelson was popped out for hard rubbish himself not long after he delivered his budget reply, whereas Mr Dutton has survived a full term as Liberal leader. In the end, the excise spell was not broken until 2014, when treasurer Joe Hockey's first budget for the Abbott government ripped off the bandaid and reinstated fuel excise indexation.  He argued that reinstating higher petrol taxes was actually a progressive taxation move as ""the poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases"". An ABC Fact Check at the time found this claim to be ""misleading"", but complicated. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     So is the Dutton announcement — according to the Hockey logic — a boon to the wealthy? It's certainly not intended as such. The petrol excise cut is intended to appeal to people in outer metropolitan areas — most significantly, stressed-out working mothers who do a lot of driving, and don't buy the idea that nuclear energy is going to do much for their energy bills. How do we know that Mr Dutton knows this? Because in the last two budget reply speeches, he has spoken at length about his nuclear energy plan. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Tonight, he used the word ""nuclear"" just twice. There was much talk of gas. But the real money went to petrol. Petrol taxes are a lever easily pulled, and easily explained. You can switch them on and off without much technical difficulty. But the difficulty is all political, which is to say they are more easily switched off than on. ""And then we'll review it,"" is what Mr Dutton says of what will happen a year from now, if he's elected. The quick fix of electoral appeal is incredibly seductive to Peter Dutton, Opposition Leader, Budget Week 2025. But would Peter Dutton, Prime Minister, Budget Week 2026 feel the same way, one wonders? Scott Morrison — in deep trouble, late in his term — cut excise in half for six months in the 2022 budget. It didn't save him. But he also didn't have to deal with the opprobrium of not renewing it.  That was Jim Chalmers' job, in his first budget. Would Peter Dutton, if elected PM, be okay with raising petrol prices in his first budget a year from now? In a week where he's also sacking public servants, slashing public spending and making whatever other tough calls he would probably have to do? While also explaining to voters why their electricity isn't 44 per cent cheaper as discussed? That's tomorrow's problem.

Compare the pair: Which major party's tax policy leaves you better off?,"With an election underway, which major party's tax policy leaves you better off?",2025-03-28 07:48:53,"A new policy battle has erupted between the two major parties, as Australians prepare to go to the polls to decide their next prime minister. Politicians know the cost-of-living crisis is still fresh in the mind of voters, and both Labor and the Coalition have pitched plans they say will ease some hip-pocket pain. A laundry list of policies has already been announced: from cheaper doctors visits, to lower cost medicines and power bill rebates. On all of those counts, the Coalition has agreed to match what Labor is putting forward, avoiding a heated debate in the lead-up to the May federal election. That changed this week when a chasm emerged between the major parties on tax plans. Labor wants to give every taxpayer a ""modest but meaningful"" tax cut, which in effect will mean the average worker gets a few hundred extra dollars in their pocket every year. That was revealed in this week's federal budget and the opposition almost immediately rejected it, waiting until the following night to announce their own surprise: cheaper petrol for one year thanks to a halving of the fuel excise. Both approaches will put extra dollars in voters pockets and could sway votes in what's expected to be a tight election race.  The government has legislated to cut the lowest tax rate — which applies to income between $18,201 and $45,000 — by one percentage point in the middle of next year, making it 15 per cent, and another percentage point a year after that, ultimately bringing it down to 14 per cent. Because of the way Australia's tax system is structured, those savings will flow through even if you earn well above the $45,000 threshold, meaning every worker will pay less tax under the changes. The federal budget includes a ""modest"" tax cut for every taxpayer, starting from next year. For a worker earning $45,000 or more a year, the value of the cut will be $268 in the first year and $536 in the following years. The savings are smaller for people under that threshold: people earning $30,000 a year will only get $118 in year one and $236 after that.  In other words, most Australians will be saving roughly an extra $5 a week in the first year of the change and $10 a week subsequently.  If you're thinking that doesn't sound like very much, you're not alone: Treasurer Jim Chalmers himself has repeatedly described the benefit as ""modest"", while the Coalition has labelled them a ""cruel hoax"".  But Labor has pitched the new cut as a ""top-up"" to their previously announced tax changes, and when taken together, the windfall for voters is more significant. Filling up at the bowser will become cheaper under a Dutton government, with the opposition vowing to halve the fuel excise — a tax paid by petrol suppliers that is passed on to customers at the pump — from 50 cents to 25 cents per litre for a year. The Coalition estimates that this would result in a saving of $14 on a 55-litre tank, which is pretty typical, or just over $700 a year for those who fill up their car about once a week. The opposition says it would repeal Labor's legislated tax cuts and halve the fuel excise for a year. For Australians that fall into that camp, the benefit of the Coalition's policy is greater than what they would get in the first year of Labor's tax cuts, but how valuable the opposition's policy is for each voter depends entirely on how much fuel they buy. For example, regional Australians, tradies and families in the suburbs who have two cars and commute longer distances will likely reap most of the rewards. The flip side is that city dwellers who rely on public transport or cycling to get around won't get anything at all. ""For tradies and everyone that's travelling in from outer suburbs to work in the city or running kids around to sport on the weekend, this will be relief for them,"" Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said.  ""That's exactly what we've designed it for."" If this all sounds familiar, it's because we've seen it before. The Morrison government halved the excise for six months on the eve of the last election after the outbreak of war in Ukraine set off a global oil price spike. That policy lapsed as planned in late 2022, despite pressure on Labor to extend it.  The tax cuts won't come into force until the middle of next year, prompting criticism from opposition that it doesn't solve the problem for households struggling now. But the benefits of Labor's will be ongoing, with the changes locked in until the government of the day decides to repeal them (the Coalition has vowed to do exactly that if they win the election).  In theory, that means the value of Labor's cuts over time could be significantly higher than what as been foreshadowed for the first two years. The opposition leader has vowed that his policy would take effect as soon as he wins office, unlike Labor's new tax cuts that are more than a year away. If the Coalition wins government, and presuming they follow through on the promise, that means Australians could begin seeing the difference at the bowser within months.  At the end of the 12 month period, the excise will revert to the original 50.8 cents or potentially slightly higher due to indexation.  First, the top line numbers: Labor's plan is forecast to cost the government coffers $17 billion over the forward estimates, while the Coalition's is expected to lead to an estimated $6 billion in lost tax revenue over the one year. Economist Saul Eslake said the Coalition's policy ""will have a bigger and more immediate impact than the government's"".  ""That is because it starts sooner and the amount being offered in the first year is bigger than under the government's plan,"" he said. Coalition rejects tax cuts and pledges to halve fuel excise if elected. But that's just one part of the picture. With inflation once again moving steadily towards the Reserve Bank's target band, and another interest rate decision due within days, some economists are wary of any announcement that could delay progress.  Angela Jackson, lead economist at Impact Economics and Policy, said the Coalition's policy has the potential to prompt the Reserve Bank to delay cutting interest rates as soon as they otherwise might have.  ""If it’s putting $6 billion back into the economy this financial year, then that’s not an insignificant amount in terms of what the Reserve Bank is looking at,"" she said. ""That doesn’t mean that interest rates won’t still come down, but it might be enough to mean they’ll come down slower than they would have without it — and you have to see the government’s energy supplement in the same realm."" Like Labor's $5.3 billion plan to extend the energy bill rebates until the end of the year, cutting the fuel excise and therefore making petrol cheaper would bring down inflation in the short-term.  But the increase in demand in the economy it may generate depending on how consumers spend their extra cash has the potential to ultimately worsen inflation. Treasury forecasts inflation will be ""sustainably"" inside the 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band before Labor's tax cuts come into play, meaning they pose less of an inflationary risk. With the budget expected to remain in deficit for the foreseeable future, the other consideration is what policies will mean for the bottom line going forward. The Coalition's spend is only for one year, meaning no ongoing hit to the budget, unlike Labor's policy.  ""But the reality is without fundamental structural reforms to the tax base or to spending, both sides are going to be facing a long period of deficits,"" Dr Jackson said.  ""I don’t think either policy fundamentally changes that.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/income-tax-cuts-fuel-excise-halved-better-off/105101874
Dutton promises lower energy prices with plan to tap gas exports,'Energy is the economy' says Peter Dutton with promise to cut prices by tapping gas exports,2025-03-28 09:06:21,"Opposition Leader Peter Dutton vows to ""immediately"" force gas giants to set aside for domestic use as much as 20 per cent of supply that would ""otherwise be exported"", cutting wholesale prices by 40 per cent. Federal election 2025: Take a look back on Tuesday's updates from the campaign trail Declaring ""energy is the economy"", Mr Dutton used his budget reply speech on Thursday to also reveal he would commit $1 billion to expand the east coast market with more gas pipelines and storage capacity. With more money for youth mental health services, targets for more apprentices, and an increase in the instant asset write-off for business to $30,000, Mr Dutton said he wants small businesses ""to be taking risks, not shutting up shop"". What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. Speaking as the government overshadowed his address to the nation by revealing it would on Friday call an election for May 3, Mr Dutton said Australians face a ""sliding door moment"" against ""another three bleak years"" under Anthony Albanese. Mr Dutton also promised a series of moves to rapidly dismantle Labor's ""Future Made in Australia"" agenda by scrapping $16 billion in legislated production tax credits for critical minerals and green hydrogen projects. The Opposition Leader said Australians were paying up to four times more for energy than people in comparable economies, despite a series of energy bill rebates that have cost the government $6.8 billion. ""We won't oppose these latest rebates, because Australians desperately need power bill relief,"" he said. In a policy the gas lobby described as ""another damaging intervention"", Mr Dutton confirmed his national gas plan would include a domestic east coast gas reservation to ""reduce energy prices for Australians"" Australian Energy Producers said the plan, foreshadowed by the ABC on Tuesday, would do more harm in the long run.  ""The Coalition's proposal to deliberately oversupply the gas market in an attempt to artificially reduce prices would be yet another damaging gas market intervention that will drive away investment and exacerbate the supply challenges in the longer term,"" chief executive Samantha McCulloch said. ""It also ignores the reality that we don't have the pipeline infrastructure to get that much gas from Queensland to the southern states, with the pipes already running at full capacity during peak periods."" Mr Dutton said it would ensure Australian gas went to Australians first and foremost. ""This will secure an additional 10 to 20 per cent of the east coast's demand — gas which would otherwise be exported. Gas giants would be forced to supply more energy to the domestic energy market in exchange for more lax environmental regulations under gas reservation plans that could be adopted by both sides of politics. ""Gas sold on the domestic market will be decoupled from overseas markets to protect Australia from international price shocks. ""And this will drive down new wholesale domestic gas prices from over $14 per gigajoule to under $10 per gigajoule."" Other elements of Mr Dutton's energy plan include reinstating a $300 million 'strategic basin plan', opening Labor's renewables 'capacity investment' market scheme to gas. At present the scheme excludes the energy source, with Labor using it to expand renewables generation and storage. ""Energy prices will always be lower under a Coalition government."" Mr Dutton has also promised to build seven nuclear power plants by the middle of this century — though doing so will require overturning federal and state nuclear bans, and the first plant will not come online until 2035 at the earliest. Want even more? Here's where you can find all our 2025 federal election coverage Mr Dutton's pitch to the nation included pledges to spend $400 million on youth mental health services and setting a target of 400,000 apprentices. The Coalition earlier announced a promise to temporarily halve the excise on fuel, shaving 25 cents off the cost of a litre of petrol. On the budget, Mr Dutton accused Labor of increasing spending as a share of the economy by more than ""any other government since the recession of the early 1990s"". ""It's lifted spending by an extraordinary $425 billion,"" he said. ""That's about $40,000 per Australian household. Much of this spending hasn't gone to essential services or generated economic activity. ""Rather, it's been inflationary, ineffectual, and wasteful. Such rapid and unrestrained spending is not only adding to the debt our children will have to repay. It's also keeping the pressure on inflation during a cost-of-living crisis — as the Reserve Bank Governor has repeatedly pointed out.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/dutton-budget-reply-promise-lower-energy-price-gas/105035596
Albanese to call May 3 federal election on Friday morning,May 3 federal election to be called by Anthony Albanese Friday morning,2025-03-27 22:37:54,"The prime minister will head to Government House on Friday to call the federal election for May 3. With both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton laying down their competing visions for the next term of parliament, the pair will now ready for a five-week campaign where they will seek to convince voters each is the right person to lead the country. Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. The cost of living is likely to dominate the campaign, with more than two years of high inflation putting the pinch on families and businesses, and each party offering its own answers on how to respond. The stage is also set for a potentially tumultuous first week on the campaign trail, with a cash rate decision by the Reserve Bank due on Tuesday and United States President Donald Trump's threat of a new round of tariffs to be announced on April 2, US time. With just three seats to lose to force Labor into minority government, and 19 for the Coalition to pick up to be able to govern in its own right, pollsters have favoured a hung parliament as the most likely outcome based on current opinion. Peter Dutton is due to deliver his Budget in Reply this evening. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) But successive polls have also identified a larger-than-usual bloc of uncommitted voters, raising the stakes for each of the leaders this campaign. Parliament frenetic on Thursday with expectation of an imminent election, and with Mr Dutton due to deliver his budget reply on Thursday evening. The ABC confirmed Mr Albanese's election plans just an hour before that event. The prime minister is now readying to visit the governor general, just down the road from Parliament House, where he will advise her to dissolve parliament, and call an election. Both camps will then race out to the seats they are hoping to hold or flip, setting off a five-week race around the country. The most hotly contested seats are around Melbourne and Sydney's outer suburbs, with polls suggesting those are among the likeliest to change hands and determine the election outcome. However both parties will have to campaign fiercely in every state and territory to guarantee enough seats to be able to govern — 76 seats are needed for an outright majority. Voter dissatisfaction with traditional politics saw the crossbench expand significantly at the last election, and a host of new independents joining the lower house. If that trend continues, it could force Labor or the Coalition into negotiations after polling day to secure confidence to govern — with the tax system, transparency and climate change among a host of priorities on the crossbench. The current crossbench is making no promises to guarantee support to either Labor or Coalition in a hung parliament — with nearly all saying they would force a minority government to deal with them bill by bill, and retain their right to withdraw support.  Among Labor's significant promises are to deliver a ""modest"" tax cut for all taxpayers that will amount to about $10 a week back in people's pockets, to build and expand 160 childcare centres under a $1 billion fund, and to slash student debts by 20 per cent as a one-time measure. Among the Coalition's significant promises are a 25 cent per litre reduction off the cost of fuel and a promise to change Australia's power mix forever by building seven nuclear power plants by 2050 — with other significant promises likely to be announced on Thursday night. Both parties have committed to more than $10 billion in health spending including measures to boost bulk-billing rates and cut the cost of medicines, a $150 energy bill rebate to be paid from July and a two-year ban on foreign investors from purchasing homes.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/albanese-expected-to-call-federal-election-this-morning/105103954
How to spot AI ahead of the federal election,How to spot artificial intelligence on social media ahead of federal election,2025-03-27 05:02:35,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has crept into almost every corner of our lives. Autocorrect on your phone? That's AI. Search engines use it based on your previous searches, and it's used in your social media algorithms, online shopping, and gaming, as well as farming, transport, and healthcare. We live with and use AI every day — even if we're not consciously aware of it. So with the federal election looming, although no date has been set yet, how will AI be used to get our votes? And how can we identify it? AI in elections isn't new. In fact, it's had a hand in some way or another since social media platforms began using it in their algorithm systems around 2015. But what makes things different for this election is that AI has become more sophisticated, and there are a lot more people online to see it. Politicians are worried deepfakes could affect the election. So, ABC News got one made to see how convincing they can be. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) says 99 per cent of Australians have internet access. This makes sharing information and getting our news simple: almost half of us get our news from social media, according to a University of Canberra study, while 60 per cent of Gen Zs rely on social media as their main news source. Even though Australia's legal voting age is 18, young people who are likely to vote in the following election are concerned. ""If I hear about something going on in the world, it will be through a friend who's heard it on social media, or it will be hearing it on social media myself,"" Freddie, 15, says. Miles agrees. "" Yeah, I get most of my news from social media, or from a friend who's heard it from social media,"" he says. Friends (from left) Freddie, 15, Miles, 14, Arthur, 13, and Max, 14, spoke to BTN High about their concerns with AI. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) Ellie, 14, says she ""sometimes gets news from social media"". ""I use mainly Tiktok, but sometimes I float around on Instagram or Snapchat or anything like that,"" she says. But how can we tell what we're seeing on social media is the real deal with the election coming up? Eliza, aged 23, says it's hard to discern what's AI-generated political content. Eliza, 23, says AI makes it hard to sort fact from fiction sometimes. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) ""Some of it is hard to denote between what's been made by a person and what's been made by artificial intelligence — and that's quite scary, to be honest,"" she says. Australian Electoral Commission state manager Cameron Stokes says AI is relatively new technology but it's emerging ""very rapidly"". Cameron Stokes from the Australian Electoral Commission. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) ""It has popped up in election campaigns over the past 12 months, both here and overseas,"" Mr Stokes says. How will AI impact the election? In the United States, researchers found X was flooded with an army of AI-powered bots spreading pro-Republican propaganda, and there were AI-generated images of Taylor Swift falsely endorsing candidates. In the UK, an avatar called AI Steve ran in the general election. And in Indonesia, political party Golkar used AI to create a deepfake video of former president Suharto encouraging voters to vote for his party, and it turned presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, a former ex-special forces commander dogged by allegations of human rights abuses, into an adorable, chubby avatar. He won the election. Senator Jacqui Lambie allowed ABC NEWS Verify to use inexpensive AI tools to create a robocall with her voice ahead of the federal election — it was good enough to fool some of her supporters. Not all AI used in elections is bad though. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi uses AI to translate his speeches in real time, so that more people can connect. Mr Stokes says the challenge for Australian voters will be to decide what's true. ""The AEC doesn't have a role in determining what's true in political advertising, that's absolutely the role of the voter,"" he says. Aazeen, aged 15, spoke of her concerns to BTN High. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) Are young Australians concerned that AI could influence the upcoming federal election? ""Definitely, if it starts looking more real than it used to,"" says 15-year-old Aaseen. Researchers from the RECapture project found videos on the Chinese social media platform RedNote targeting Australian politicians, with AI-generated videos of Peter Dutton supposedly speaking fluent Mandarin saying he intends to deport Chinese Australians. Sam, 14, (left) with Aston, 15, predicts it will get harder to tell what's real as AI advances in technology. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) AI is getting good. Especially older people wouldn't be able to tell if it's AI or not, so they could get tricked into voting for certain people. — Ethan, 13 I've been tricked a lot of times … the really good AI videos, you'll have to look for it, but you can always find a bit of an inconsistency. — Freddie, 15 It could influence a small part of the population, but I can't see it really changing the whole side. — Aston, 15 AI isn't really that advanced, but I'm guessing in the future it will become more realistic and harder to tell. — Sam, 14 Eliza, 23, thinks AI has gotten a little bit out of hand at this point, but other young people aren't that concerned. It is getting worryingly good, but I don't think it's good enough to really trick anyone about anything important. — Max, 14 I feel like AI is very inconsistent, like photos or speeches and stuff. — Ellie, 14 Right now, it's not that big of a threat. But I think, in a few years, maybe even three years, it could be a lot bigger threat than it is now. — Miles, 14 Ethan, 13, (right) with 14-year-old friends Sienna and Ellie, says AI ""is getting good"". (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) Robert, 32, feels a lot of people are losing their basic judgement and critical thinking when it comes to social media. ""We're focusing on something fun instead of thinking,"" he says. Robert, aged 32, says it's important to think about what you see. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio) AAP FactCheck recently confirmed it will continue to provide checks for Meta for at least another 12 months while international news wire AFP told the ABC the outlet was also committed to fact-checking for this year in Australia.

7 The Coalition voted down Labor's income tax cuts in parliament on Wednesday, ahead of offering voters a different cost-saving measure. It shows the parties' alternate proposals on living costs, after the opposition neutralised Labor's health policies on Medicare and cheaper PBS medications. The fuel excise is a federal government tax collected from producers or importers when the fuel leaves their depot. While suppliers can set their own prices, the cost of fuel at the petrol station generally fluctuates in line with wholesale prices. Coalition rejects tax cuts and pledges to halve fuel excise if elected. A competition watchdog review found a previous cut to the excise resulted in sharp price falls across the country. That was when the tax was slashed for six months under the former Liberal government to help combat a spike in fuel prices facing drivers, but the Labor government let the discount lapse after they were elected, arguing it was too costly. Ahead of its expiration in 2022, Mr Dutton used Question Time to quiz the government about if it would extend the cut. The opposition leader has refused to rule out his own version of the surprise $17 billion tax cuts revealed in Labor's budget last night. A year later, amid a prolonged period of above $2 petrol prices in late 2023, Independent MP Dai Le called on the government to bring back the discount. At the time, Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who represents the regional Queensland seat of Leichhardt, told the ABC the revenue helped to fund the nation's road network. While the revenue raised through the tax was historically tied to road funding, in recent decades it has operated more as a general revenue-raising tax, therefore the opposition said its policy would not reduce road funding.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-26/coalition-halve-fuel-excise-25-cent-petrol/105100580

7 While there were modest tax cuts announced, some who contacted the ABC — like Hobart man Tony Haigh — lamented the fact that there was nothing about more long-term tax reform.

He was disappointed about the failure to address Australia's energy transition to renewables. ""An energy bill relief of $150 over the second half of the year is a minor one-off payment that does not do anything about the transition. Surely the Black Summer fires, the floods and the ex-cyclone hitting South East Queensland should have woken up the politicians from their slumber?""

Dutton flags details of election pitch to come in budget reply,Peter Dutton flags cost of living and security as key pillars of election pitch,2025-03-26 08:56:13,"Peter Dutton has flagged he will set up his election pitch to voters when he delivers his budget reply speech on Thursday, refusing to rule out his own version of the surprise tax cuts revealed in Labor's budget.   The opposition leader gave a few hints to what that election platform would include in his post-budget interview with ABC Radio on Wednesday, outlining his key priorities but declining to give any specifics.  They included providing support for families struggling with the cost of living, fixing the energy system, cutting back on migration, freeing up housing, providing guarantees around health and education funding, and lastly ensuring Australia's security in a ""very uncertain world"". Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. He also branded Labor's tax cuts — which will be worth about $5 a week to the average worker — an ""election bribe"" and ""slap in the face"" to households, but would not be drawn on whether his rejection meant the Coalition was planning their own bigger tax package. ""We'll give our budget reply on Thursday night,"" he said. He gave the same answer when questioned about when he would release the specific details of the Coalition's plan to cut waste in the public service. The Albanese government has delivered its final budget ahead of an election in May, with a fresh new round of tax cuts the major offer. Find out who else is set to benefit and who may miss out. The budget papers revealed the number of public servants has now grown by about 41,000 since the Coalition was in power, with Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor confirming on Tuesday night they would seek to slash those jobs if elected at the next election. Up until now the Coalition has refused to provide details of how they would get to that goal, but on Wednesday Mr Taylor seemed to give the first hint that it could be achieved through ""attrition"" — in other words, not through job losses.  ""We know that the public service has got so big now that attrition rates are high and so, let's be clear, that would be what we are relying on,"" he said. Asked whether attrition alone would be enough to reach their target, Mr Taylor flagged they would have more to say over the coming weeks. ""We want a public service that delivers for Australians, where people are excited and empowered to work, where bureaucracy doesn't control everything, where people can get on with their jobs and that doesn't need to be a bigger public service,"" he said. The $17.1 billion for an income tax cut for every Australian worker was the major surprise of Jim Chalmer's fourth budget as treasurer, which he handed down on Tuesday night. In his post-budget media rounds, the treasurer was keen to focus on the measure which he described as ""modest in isolation"" but ""meaningful"" when combined with the other previously announced tax breaks. The cuts will start in the middle of next year and would deliver the average wage earner about $268 in annual income tax cuts. Labor has spent the morning after budget spruiking their new ""modest"" income tax cuts.  (ABC News: Matt Roberts) ""The election is going to be a pretty clear choice,"" Mr Chalmers said. ""And that choice is crystallising between a Labor government which is cutting taxes to help people with the cost of living, or Peter Dutton who has secret cuts which will make people worse off — not better off."" The government introduced legislation for the tax cuts to parliament early on Wednesday, in a bid to force the Coalition to promise to repeal the cuts if it wins the election — which is due on or before May 17.  Speaking in the House of Representatives, the treasurer declared that ""to stand in the way of this legislation is to vote for higher taxes"". ""To vote against this legislation would be to stand in the way of more hard-earned money staying in the pockets of every hard-working Australian,"" he said.  After two back-to-back budget surpluses, the government has had to sell a $42.1 billion deficit and a bottom line that is expected to remain in the red for the next decade.  But Prime Minister Anthony Albanese focused instead on the drop in the deficit compared to what was forecast at the last election in 2022.  ""We've already had some almost $100 billion of savings, we've been responsible in the way that we've managed the economy,"" he said. ""We inherited in that first year a $78 billion deficit that we turned into a $20 billion Labor surplus. We followed that up with another surplus. And in last night's budget we've halved the deficit."" All fields are required unless marked optional.

Consider this the treasurer's refusal to sign a non-compete clause,Consider this budget Treasurer Jim Chalmers' refusal to sign a non-compete clause,2025-03-25 20:21:48,"This budget comprises many pages, most of which will no doubt blow away in the gales of the imminent election campaign, but one conclusion is visible from space and should absolutely be noted: this is Jim Chalmers's formal refusal to sign a non-compete clause. Have you ever seen a treasurer, obliged on budget night to confirm that the national books have slid $42b into the red on his watch, looking quite so incredibly chipper? Energised, articulate, armed with charts demonstrating that Australia has finally achieved the ""soft landing"" he's been promising all this time, Mr Chalmers addressed journalists in the budget lock-up with the controlled excitement of a guy who's about to give his kids a pony. Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. ""One of the things that makes me really optimistic about our country is that we've found a way to make some pretty remarkable progress in the last few years,"" he enthused. Utterly unshamed by the opposition's complaints of his excessive spending, Mr Chalmers bowled up today with some more: new tax cuts amounting to $17 billion. Tuesday night's federal budget outlined billions of dollars worth of spending due to ""unavoidable policy decisions"".  (ABC News: Adam Kennedy) The other main reveal — from a budget whose major elements were telegraphed in advance, especially the, ah, screaming deficit issue — was that the government plans to ban non-compete clauses for most workers. Was that a manic twinkle in his eye, as Mr Chalmers explained that banning the growing scourge of non-compete clauses enforced on ordinary workers would further advance our nation's ""exceptionalism"" by unlocking vast reserves of productivity and contributing up to $5 billion to Australia's GDP? ""People shouldn't need to hire a lawyer to take the next step in their career,"" he later told the Parliament. For Mr Chalmers — a man widely reputed to be interested in taking the next step in his career, possibly to a degree that might antagonise his boss — today was quite a remarkable performance. The budget is replete with attractive spending, including in the Coalition's favourite realm — tax cuts. This gives Opposition Leader Peter Dutton two sleeps to decide: do his strong views on fiscal restraint extend to denying lovely tax cuts to battlers? Or, to put it another way — will he compete? And there are no scorching cuts or revenue measures in this budget creating losers with whom the opposition can profitably empathise. Tax cheats? Illicit tobacco overlords? People who don't want to pay less for beer? Economists scandalised by the lack of structural reform? Even for a populist opposition leader of considerable talent, this budget is a tough room to scan for allies. Unless, of course, you include the prime minister, one of the nation's hardworking bosses who now faces the threat of their subordinates cutting their professional lunch. The budget may be going to hell in a red hand basket, but you kind of have to pay the tactic. As is routine for a pre-election budget — and especially unsurprising in one that wasn't even going to be delivered until a certain tropical cyclone came slouching towards the coast of Queensland just weeks ago — the document itself contains a certain amount of careful obfuscation and language management. It's not long since we had MYEFO, the mid-year economic statement. But according to Budget Paper 1, a few things have shifted in those scant months. In what seems like unusually defensive language, Budget Paper 1 tautly advises that since MYEFO, the government has been obliged to commit an additional $3.5 billion to what is described in bold type as ""addressing unavoidable issues"". The headline places some strain on the dictionary definition of ""unavoidable"", especially when you consider that — to choose an example — $156 million of it is to address the scorching national outbreak of illicit tobacco sales that surely has something to do with past budget decisions to jack up the tobacco excise? Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Another unavoidable issue was the increased wage bill for aged care workers occasioned by the Fair Work Commission giving them a pay rise. Under encouragement from the government, though, so does that make it truly unavoidable? Other unavoidable expenditures came from new listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which when you think about it were approved by … oh, you get the idea. Something called the ""Australian Screen and Digital Game Production Incentive"" is projected to blow out by half a billion dollars over the next four years. Turns out this includes the ""location offset"", an eye-poppingly expensive scheme whereby we subsidise Marvel productions to come to Australia, so don't go out and start a digital game design business on the strength of this section of budget viscera. Such intricate reversals and rearrangements are usual in a budget, especially a pre-election one. The main things you need to know? We're in a sea of red. But there's money everywhere. Some of it — like the electricity rebate — will come your way no matter what you earn. Mr Chalmers has a royal flush of deficits, an advancing trade war, and a parliamentary margin so slender that this might well be his last budget. But he's here to compete. Against all comers.

The $17b tax cut no-one saw coming came at the right time for Labor,The $17b tax cut no-one saw coming leads a pre-election budget where everyone's a winner,2025-03-25 20:18:49,"The golden rule of federal budgets is that they progressively become more benign with the approach of an election. Get all the tough stuff out of the way early on in proceedings until you get to the final year when you can start doling out the largesse. This budget is right on cue. Lots of handouts and extra spending with nary a revenue raising measure in sight. Everyone's a winner, and not a loser to be found. Even beer drinkers have something to celebrate, as if they didn't normally, with a freeze on excise duties. Treasurer Jim Chalmers warned there would be little, if anything, new in this document given the government had planned to call an election earlier this month, negating the need for a budget. Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. As a result, almost all the landmark policies — such as the huge lift in Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and student relief — had already been announced. That plan took an abrupt about turn, courtesy of Cyclone Alfred, leaving the Treasurer with little ammunition to fire. But he did hold one measure in reserve, another couple of personal income tax cuts. Modest, maybe, but phased in from next year in two instalments and distributed to everyone via a cut in the rate of the lowest bracket, which initially will be shaved from 16 per cent to 15 per cent, and then 14 per cent the following year. Once fully implemented, it will add just $536 to the average earner's take-home pay packet over the course of a year. While that's barely enough for a weekly burger, at a national level, it doesn't come cheap. All up around $17.1 billion will be stripped from government revenue over the three years in the forward estimates. Still, that's far less than the massive Stage 3 cuts that landed last year which lopped more than $20 billion a year from annual revenue and contributed to the retreat into deficit this year. Forget what any of them say. If there's one thing a treasurer cherishes, it's bracket creep. It delivers two valuable prizes. The first is that it helps narrow the gap between spending and income without having to do much at all. And the second is that it, in an election year, the government throw its hands up in the air in horror at having just discovered this diabolical situation with a promise to dole out a tax cut to a grateful electorate. Oddly enough, no-one has ever been tempted to eliminate bracket creep by simply indexing the tax brackets to wages growth. Simple! Er, maybe not. Longer term, this budget — like those for the past 15 or more years — is structured around a hope wages growth and the corresponding lift in income tax will eventually get the budget back into balance. So far, unfortunately, it's a strategy that has largely failed as spending has consistently outstripped revenue, entrenching what's known as a ""structural deficit"". This graph from the budget papers tells that story. The only problem is that bracket creep isn't expected to save the budget for another decade. And, given the turmoil in global geopolitics, the chances these forecasts are in any way accurate are mighty slim. Government revenue and expenses over the past five decades. (Supplied: Treasury) If there has been a triumph in our economic performance in the past three years, it has been the outstanding strength of the labour market. For a while there, unemployment was sitting around 3.5 per cent. Even now, it is only marginally above 4 per cent and Treasury estimates that the jobless rate will peak at just 4.25 per cent. That's after one of the most aggressive interest rate hiking cycles in history and an unprecedented surge in migration. The budget impact from that unexpected jobs bonanza has been a far stronger than anticipated rise in personal income tax receipts. Can it last another decade? Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     After all the fanfare last year, with the Future Made in Australia initiatives, this year's budget was far more muted. But that was a different era. It was a time when then President Joe Biden and his administration was scouring the world looking for new opportunities and splashing cash around to secure critical minerals and friendly partners. More than mere extraction, digging dirt out of the ground, there was a push for Australia to get more involved in processing. It was also a time when our energy companies and miners like Andrew Forrest were exploring green hydrogen and other renewable technologies. The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has dampened that enthusiasm. So too has the collapse in the price of some key critical minerals such as lithium and nickel, as well as the soaring cost and technical difficulties of producing green hydrogen. The commitment might remain intact but the measures announced in this year's budget are being financed with previously allocated funds. There's $3 billion to support the production of green metals like aluminium and iron, and a recapitalisation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation with funds from entities that already have been funded. With the US committed to bringing industry back home, the idea of subsidising domestic manufacturing has taken a back seat for fear of antagonising the White House. A week from now, Donald Trump will announce his global trade sanctions, a day he's dubbed Liberation Day. It may end up having a longer term impact on our future than this year's budget.

Surprise $17b in tax cuts sets up election clash,Election battlelines drawn as tax clash overshadows 'budget for uncertain times',2025-03-25 21:59:51,"Labor and the Coalition will square off at the coming election over competing tax goals, with the government offering voters ""modest but meaningful"" income tax cuts that the opposition quickly dismissed as ""a cruel hoax"". Australians will have a choice between Labor's $17 billion in tax cuts that start in the middle of next year — delivering the average wage earner $268 in annual income tax cuts — and a yet-to-be-revealed Coalition alternative. Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. Within moments of the budget being revealed, shadow Treasury spokesperson Angus Taylor rejected the government's centrepiece cuts and pointedly left the door open to his own version. Challenged on ABC's 730 about whether he would rule out offering personal tax relief at the coming election battle, Mr Taylor said, ""that's not what I said"". ""I said that we will not be supporting what Labor has proposed in this budget and that's what we're responding to tonight,"" he added. He slammed the government's cuts as an ""election bribe by a weak prime minister."" Labor's surprise income tax offering has up-ended the government's pre-budget expectations management, which was that there would be no big new announcements. But it has also reignited debate over the nation's tax structure, which budget economists predict will increasingly rely on income taxes paid by younger voters. The cuts also delay by two years the effects of so-called ""bracket creep"", the process by which workers winning pay increases get pushed up the income tax scales, effectively eroding their salary gains. Describing his cuts as ""modest and meaningful"", Treasurer Jim Chalmers said they would mean workers earning an average $79,000 a year would pay $268 less tax in the first year and $536 less a year later. Independent MP Allegra Spender, a potential kingmaker if the coming election falls short of delivering either side a majority, was scathing of the cuts. ""I wouldn't describe this as tax reform. I would describe this as a tax cut,"" she told the ABC. ""I want to see a reduction on our reliance on personal income taxes, but we have a long way to go to make this tax system really work for young people."" ""I'd love to see broader reform … [this is] nowhere near enough."" Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie was equally critical, describing the government's cuts as ""nothing to brag about here"". ""Giving rich people more tax cuts is not a viable option."" With a warning that ""storm clouds are gathering"" from the US president's coming tariffs, weaker Chinese growth, an ongoing war in Europe and collapsing peace in the Middle East, Dr Chalmers details plans to cut the 16 per cent tax rate to 15 per cent next year and 14 per cent in mid-2027. Labor also announced it will make it easier for workers to switch jobs by abolishing non-compete clauses in workplace contracts, a move aimed at bolstering labour-force mobility and raising living standards. Despite generating $180 billion in budget deficits through 2028-29 — including a $42.1 billion shortfall in 2025-26 — Mr Chalmers said the tax cuts would boost the economy by raising incentives to work for low-income and part-time workers, predominantly women. Treasury calculates the tax cuts mean the average tax rate for middle-income workers is not expected to exceed the 2023-24 level until 2031-32, giving an extra two years of ""bracket creep"" compensation. ""This budget is our plan for a new generation of prosperity in a new world of uncertainty,"" Mr Chalmers said in his speech to parliament. Labor hopes Tuesday's budget will create a clear distinction in the minds of voters between the government's focus on household relief and the Coalition's track record during the past three years of opposing such spending as ""sugar hits"". Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to trigger an election as early as Friday, and potentially as late as Sunday week, for an election date in early to mid-May. In a sign the government continues to expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to bring fresh interest rate relief, Mr Chalmers says Treasury forecasts inflation will be ""sustainably"" inside the 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band, hitting that point six months earlier than predicted at the pre-Christmas update. ""It might be a budget on the eve of an election, but we've found savings and economic reforms,"" he said. The budget papers show the consumer price index will rise 2.5 per cent on average this financial year, before growing 3 per cent the following year. Government officials are bracing for a potential wave of global inflation triggered by the Trump tariffs. But it is understood officials are still keeping an open mind about the full impacts of tariffs, especially if countries adopt retaliatory measures against the US. While tariffs drive up prices, the disruption and uncertainty created by the White House could derail economic growth by damaging consumer and business confidence. Under that scenario, inflation pressures may ease faster than anticipated, creating additional scope for central banks outside the US to cut interest rates. The US president often says ""tariff"" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool. Treasury predicts the US economy will grow by 2 per cent, which is slightly lower than the official US Federal Reserve prediction. ""Australia is neither uniquely impacted nor immune from these pressures, but we are among the best-placed to navigate them,"" he said. Treasury papers show the budget bottom line improved by $36 billion over four years, helped by higher commodity prices and lower spending on the NDIS — now expected to reach the government's 8 per cent spending growth rate in the coming financial year. That would be about one year earlier than anticipated. NDIS spending growth is currently just over 10 per cent a year, down from 22 per cent in 2022. But those savings and revenue upgrades were almost entirely offset by income tax cuts and a $20 billion increase in spending on Medicare bulk-billing, drugs, energy bill relief and school funding. In addition, illegal tobacco and vape sales wiped about $7 billion from expected revenue over the coming five years. Taken together, Labor's decisions mean the budget is forecast to remain in structural deficit through 2035-36, with net debt rising from 19.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 21.5 per cent in 2025-26 and 23.1 per cent in 2028-29. Spending as a proportion of the economy will jump from 26.2 per cent to 27 per cent in 2025-26, the highest rate since the pandemic when government outlays leapt to a post-war record 31.4 per cent. Real spending growth of 6 per cent in 2024-25 will cool to 3 per cent in the coming financial year and 0.5 per cent in 2026-27. Labor's budget includes more than $1 billion in spending decisions that have been taken but not yet announced, and are expected to be rolled out during the campaign. Mr Chalmers indicated Labor decided to roll the latest income tax cuts over two years to avoid triggering an inflationary reaction in the economy. While acknowledging the tax cuts as ""modest"", he urged voters to consider them as part of Labor's broader cost-of-living relief, including energy bill support and last year's reworked stage three 3 cuts.

"Staring down years of deficits, Chalmers spruiks budget as a 'platform for prosperity'","Staring down years of deficits, Chalmers spruiks budget as a 'platform for prosperity'",2025-03-25 11:09:27,"With an expected decade of deficits on the horizon, Treasurer Jim Chalmers will try to convince voters that today's federal budget manages to balance the need to keep a lid on spending while giving struggling households enough support.  Another key pillar of Mr Chalmers' fourth budget as treasurer will be shoring up Australia's economic ""resilience"" in the face of rising global uncertainty, most notably the spectre of further tariffs under United States President Donald Trump.  After two federal budget surpluses, this time the treasurer will have to sell a deficit of around $26.9 billion, with an election looming just around the corner. Budget 2025 Live: Follow our live coverage as Peter Dutton presents his response in our live blog. But while the Coalition has accused Labor of handing down a ""budget for five weeks"" — referring to the length of an election campaign — Mr Chalmers described it as a responsible budget that will help with the cost of living while setting up Australia's future. Doing the media rounds this morning, the treasurer touted the previous surpluses and an $207 billion turnaround in the budget's fortunes, while playing down expectations of any big surprises. ""We've delivered two surpluses, we've shrunk the deficit for this year, we've engineered that $207 billion improvement — that means less debt and less debt interest at the same time,"" he said outside an entrance to Parliament House in Canberra. ""So that we can make room to strengthen Medicare and help with the cost of living and build Australia's future as well."" While Mr Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have identified cost of living as the number one issue in the mind of voters, and therefore a focus of the budget, most if not all of their key support measures have already been announced, including boosts to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Is any more cost-of-living relief expected in the budget? (Kirsten Aiken) Over the weekend the government announced an extension to the energy bill relief scheme, meaning another $150 for all households at a cost of about $1.8 billion over the forward estimates.   But he would not be drawn on whether it will become a permanent feature of budgets going forward, if the government is re-elected in May. ""From budget to budget, we review the cost-of-living policies to make sure that we're doing what we meaningfully can to help people in the most responsible way,"" he said. The energy bill relief, along with other previously announced measures, have already been provisioned for in the budget. Another ""defining feature"" of the budget, which the treasurer was keen to stress today, is shoring up Australia's economic resilience amid what he called ""global economic uncertainty"". The Trump administration is expected to announce a new wave of reciprocal tariffs next week on April 2 — which they have labelled ""Liberation Day"" — with fears several key exports could be impacted. It was the federal budget that almost didn't happen, but the government is set to deliver its fourth budget tonight before voters head to the polls by mid-May. Here's every announcement that we already know about. In response, Mr Chalmers foreshadowed that there would be ""a little bit of funding"" to promote a new ""Buy Australia"" campaign, alongside investments in green metals. ""We're a very trade exposed country. We're not uniquely impacted by these tariffs out of Washington DC, but we've got a lot of skin in the game,"" he said. ""And so what the budget will be about in addition to helping with the cost of living and strengthening Medicare, it will also be about making us more resilient to these external shocks."" Asked if there was a contingency in the budget to deal with any unexpected tariff announcements, the treasurer said the plan was to ""make the economy more resilient"". ""When we talk about building Australia's future, what we're really talking about is making our economy more competitive and dynamic and productive but also more resilient,"" he said. After Australia's bottom line is revealed when Mr Chalmers stands up in the House of Representatives this evening, attention will turn to the Coalition who will be under pressure to provide details of how they plan to cut back on Labor's spending.  The Coalition has already agreed to match many of the government's key measures, including an $8.5 billion lift on Medicare. Speaking to journalists in Parliament House this morning, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor painted a grim picture of the economy. He said the situation was ""dire for Australian households"" who are struggling to put food on the table; the economy was a ""complete and utter disaster""; and that there had been an ""absolute loss of hope"" amongst people keen to buy a house or pay off their mortgage. Mr Taylor also attacked the treasurer, who he said ""doesn't understand economics"". One of the Coalition's key messages in recent weeks has been their plan to cut waste in the public service, which Mr Taylor returned to today. ""You don't need to have a bigger team to have a better team and I've got to say that this treasurer seems to think the exact opposite,"" he said. As for Mr Chalmers' focus on resilience, Mr Taylor added: ""The only resilience this bloke wants is at the election. That's all he cares about. This is a budget for the next five weeks.""

Gas giants could be forced to divert supply to Australia,Gas giants could be forced to divert supply to Australia,2025-03-24 17:05:28,"Gas giants would be forced to supply more energy to the domestic energy market under gas reservation plans that could be adopted by both sides of politics in an election shootout over how best to secure more energy and drive down prices. In moves that would unsettle some of Australia's biggest export partners led by Japan, the Coalition is close to announcing details of its ""prospective"" gas reservation plan in exchange for easing environmental and carbon emissions regulations on developers. Sources told the ABC that Peter Dutton was originally expected to announce the policy during the election campaign. But there is now speculation the opposition leader could make it a key element of his budget reply speech on Thursday. ""It's becoming imminent,"" one source said. The Coalition has been developing a policy to secure more gas for Australia. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) There is widespread industry expectation that Labor is poised and ready to immediately counter Mr Dutton with its own version of a reservation aimed at boosting the supply of gas to the east-coast energy market. A domestic reservation has long been regarded as a bridge too far for the major parties, which are fearful of being accused of generating ""sovereign risk"" for global investors and energy giants that have sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into gas export infrastructure. However, with a hung parliament seen as increasingly possible, the idea has been given fresh weight because many teals and independents are in favour of garnishing a greater portion of gas production for domestic users. The Coalition will announce its reservation policy alongside a wide suite of promises that it says will ""flood"" the market with gas by 2028, which is when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says the market will suffer a supply shortfall. Gas consumption in Australia is falling faster than anticipated, helping to avoid the risks of seasonal shortages in the next few years, according to energy commentators. Energy experts warn that the devil is in the detail of any reservation policy, which economists regard as an effective subsidy because it effectively shifts supply destined for export markets, where prices are higher, to domestic buyers who are being guaranteed a lower price. Grattan Institute energy expert Tony Wood said the problem with a gas reservation policy was that it effectively forced producers to put supply into the market at a loss. ""The difficulty for the reservation policy is working out what the number should be so the market is oversupplied and prices come down,"" he said. ""In some way, you end up subsidising domestic use of gas. If that's what you want to do, that's fine. Could it be made to work? Maybe."" While both major parties would insist their reservation policies apply only to future gas projects, the industry is bracing for a potential fight over the fine print. Among the gas giants' concerns is any policy that muddies the definition of an existing gas project. For example, would new wells that are drilled in existing gas fields be regarded as additional and therefore required to supply the domestic reservations? Or would the policy only apply to future supply contracts? The constitution limits the application of any federal gas reservation policy to offshore gas, which means it will cover future gas projects off the Northern Territory and Western Australia, as well as Bass Strait, Gippsland and Otway zones. In addition to reservations on new gas in those areas, the opposition believes it can quickly unlock about 143 petajoules of gas each year by fast-tracking about a dozen projects awaiting approvals. Current domestic demand is about 400 PJs a year. The Coalition's list of likely projects that could be up and running by 2028 include Narrabri, which is onshore, Gippsland's Lake Blue Energy Wombat project, and GB Energy's Golden Beach Gas Field. Many of those face stiff resistance from environmental groups. The Coalition's gas plan, which has been brewing for several months, forms the core of Mr Dutton's $331 billion nuclear energy plan. Given the Coalition plan's likely decades-long lead-in time for nuclear energy, gas will be needed as an interim energy source as coal power generation exits the market. Labor's energy plans have their own need for more gas, which the government says will be needed to ""firm"" or back up intermittent wind and solar power. Gas reservation policies already exist at the state level, including WA and Queensland, where acreage released for development includes a domestic supply requirement. Nationals leader David Littleproud said on Monday that the Coalition would ""flood"" the market with gas, which he said was the ""only input that you can ramp up supply [for] quickly"". ""The others, in building a coal-fired power station, a nuclear power plant, or even a wind or solar farm of industrial scale, take too long,"" he said. ""Whereas gas, you can get into the grid in 12 to 18 months and put that downward pressure on energy prices, and that'll put downward pressure on your grocery bill and the entire economy."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday scoffed at the former Coalition government's ""gas-led recovery"", saying it led nowhere, and that providing the industry with policy certainty was the key. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie blasted the government's planned household energy relief, saying it was money that would flow to multinational energy companies. Instead, Labor should consider a gas reserve policy, she said. ACT senator David Pocock said uncontracted gas should be diverted into the domestic market. ""We don't have a gas supply shortage, we have a gas export problem,"" he said. ""We prioritise exporting gas ahead of actually looking after Australian households and businesses."" Opposition resources spokeswoman Susan McDonald told The Australian last month that the Coalition would demand producers ""prioritise"" the domestic market as part of faster environmental approvals. ""There will be a certain proportion that they will have to commit to the domestic market,"" she said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-24/gas-export-divert-domestic-reservation-supply/105090428

We're at a turning point in world history but our leaders are distracted,We're at a turning point in world history but our leaders are distracted,2025-03-24 13:03:35,"Australia is heading towards minority government at a turning point in world history. This is a time when clear political vision and decisive leadership is called for, when the stakes for Monday's federal budget and the coming election couldn't be higher. Not that you would know it from the grubby squabbles that pass for national debate these days. America's democracy is under attack from an autocratic cabal of political extremists and billionaires; Europe and China are frantically trying to Trump-proof themselves; Russia and Israel are carrying out brutal assaults and refuse to stop; the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere last year was the largest in history, and the global temperature was the hottest; and an automation and robotics revolution is in the midst of a great leap forward towards … what? No one knows. The reality of global warming is one issue Australia's leaders should be talking about.  (Reuters: Pilar Olivares) Lenin's quote that ""there are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen"" is getting a solid workout these days, but last week there was a single day on which decades happened. It was Tuesday, March 18. Here's what happened on that day: The last of these could end up being the most significant, although there's stiff competition, especially from the assault on American democracy. Trump's attacks on the judiciary pre-election, as he personally fought criminal prosecution, was one thing. But the way it's escalating from the White House is stress-testing the separation of powers. The Trump regime is now openly, vehemently defying the two other arms of US government — the judiciary and Congress — and there is no longer any doubt about what they are doing: that is, an autocratic takeover of the country. They're not even trying to hide it any more. The challenge this will present for whoever is running the Australian government over the next three years could not be greater: even if the ANZUS treaty holds in theory, can the US be relied upon anymore? And what will be the economic impact of three years of trade war? That cyclone is combining with global warming and automation to form an immense Fujiwara effect (the name for what happens when cyclones merge). I dealt with climate change last week; the rest of today's column will focus on robotics and AI. The world's first side-flipping humanoid robot: Unitree G1. inait, and its forerunner not-for-profit, The Open Brain Institute, have spent 20 years building a digital brain with 1 billion euros from the EU. They've now done it, incredibly, and Microsoft has been invited to help commercialise it. Announcing the deal last Tuesday, Microsoft called it a new artificial intelligence paradigm, but that doesn't come close to describing its significance. In a presentation to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, the founder of inait, Professor Henry Markram said: ""A digital brain is a computer model of the brain. It is a replica of the brain. It copies the shape, the dimensions and the behaviour of the synapses, the neurons, the brain circuits, the brain regions, the whole brain."" In short, this form of AI will be able to behave like a human being — that is, learn on the job and respond in real time to what's happening around it. Put it inside a humanoid robot and it's a person. The future rarely unfolds like we expect. Although Hollywood has given us plenty of technological tropes to worry about, our AI future is much more mundane and much more insidious. The deal with Microsoft is designed to sell it to companies so they can replace those who, inconveniently, have to eat, breathe, sleep and love. Even before this digital brain takes AI to a new level, automation and robotics are producing a revolution that will mean all manufacturing and almost all professions can be fully automated. Production of all goods and most services will be 24/7, all day, every day, with higher productivity than any human can achieve, allowing massive increases in output and reductions in cost. Two extremes may eventuate. Society could collapse, as those who own these means of production make off with the loot and cause inequality to skyrocket, or it will flourish because firm, benevolent political leadership makes sure that doesn't happen, and the benefits and difficulties are equally shared. It seems pretty clear that the billionaires now running America are leaning towards the first of those outcomes. Can the rest of the world make sure they don't succeed? Happily, or unhappily — I can't decide which — Trump and his gang seem determined to destroy the US economy with tariffs, austerity and administrative chaos, and in any case, it looks like the future of technology is being taken out of American hands by China. China is so far ahead in high-tech manufacturing that it looks impossible for the US to catch up. China has long led the world in high-volume manufacturing and recently its engineering quality has grown to be competitive in several industries: batteries, renewables, drones and electric vehicles. Chinese firm DJI accounts for over 80 per cent of the global commercial drone market and 90 per cent of the American consumer market. China is the leading producer of renewable energy equipment and electric cars — all cars in fact — and they are very good, and very cheap. Now, it's taking the lead in robotics: more than 250,000 robots per year are being installed in China, compared with tens of thousands in the US and Europe, and Chinese firms are supplying about 50 per cent of the local market. The most viable humanoid robot on the global market, China's Unitree G1, is now entirely decoupled from American components. The Unitree G1 humanoid biped robot on display at Japan Robot Week in 2024. (REUTERS/Issei Kato) Given the huge advantage it is now developing in robotics and high-tech manufacturing, China is the only country in a position to make and sell the equipment world-wide, with Taiwan making the computer chips for the brains. Meanwhile in Australia, we are heading into another small, dreary cost-of-living election, arguing about power bill relief and non-existent nuclear power stations, when we should really be talking about the great American retreat, the reality of global warming, and the potential for wholesale replacement of human employment.

Labor reveals $2.1 billion in savings as it prepares to hand down budget,"Labor banks more savings from cutting consultants, outstripped by new spending",2025-03-24 11:33:36,"Labor says it has saved another $720 million on private consultants, part of $2.1 billion in cuts to be included in Tuesday's federal budget as it prepares for an election tussle over the level of government spending. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said returning ""expensive"" outsourced work to government departments — which has yielded $4.7 billion in total savings across Labor's first term — was more cost effective than the Coalition's proposal to cut public servants. ""It has meant we can invest in the things that matter most, like cost of living support, Medicare, and housing,"" she said. The federal government will extend its energy bill subsidies until the end of 2025 as it frames its re-election pitch to voters around the cost of living. But the $2.1 billion reduction is comfortably less than the new spending that will be in the budget, including $8.5 billion for bulk billing and $1.8 billion to extend energy bill subsidies. And the figure includes ""re-prioritisations"" — spending reductions that are cancelled out by a spending increase elsewhere in the same portfolio. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged a similar bottom line to December's mid-year budget update, so the gap between the new spending and the cuts is likely to be funded by upgrades to the estimates of how much tax will be collected. The Coalition has matched most of Labor's new spending and promises new spends of its own, including $5 billion for housing infrastructure and an unspecified taxpayer cost to build nuclear power plants, likely well in excess of $100 billion. But Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said the Coalition would spend less overall than whatever Labor offers voters on Tuesday. ""We'll put out more costings before the election [but] I'll say that, in aggregate, our position will be stronger than Labor's,"" he told the ABC's Insiders on Sunday. Mr Taylor said he would restore a budget rule that real spending can grow no faster than the economy, measured over both the four-year forward estimates period and the ten-year medium term period. Labor's own medium-term projections suggest that level would not be breached on average over the next decade, but it would be breached for the 2024-25 financial year, and several key spending areas are growing much faster, including the NDIS, aged care, health and defence spending. That has prompted Labor accusations that the Coalition plans ""secret cuts"" to frontline services to meet its target, which it denies. Asked whether there was a specific growth target for the NDIS, finance spokesperson Jane Hume said ""the most important thing is in the long-term that all government spending doesn't grow faster than the economy itself"" and added she hoped Labor would ""work with us"" on containing costs. NDIS costs were slated to grow at 14 per cent a year when Labor took office, but that is now 8 per cent after new legislation passed with Coalition support. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Coalition was ""making it up as it goes along"" on the NDIS and that this ""would send a shiver up the spine of people who rely on the program"". Elsewhere, the government has ruled out boosting the level of defence spending again this budget, having promised new spending in the last budget after its strategic review. Mr Taylor said the Coalition would reveal its own intentions after the budget. Angus Taylor confirms the Coalition plans to reduce overall government spending growth and temporary migrant numbers, but says figures will be finalised after Tuesday's budget.  And while the Coalition has matched Labor's expanded energy bill relief, after opposing earlier rounds, Peter Dutton on Sunday said it was evidence Labor had failed to reduce power bills. But the taxpayer cost of the Coalition's own plan to build taxpayer-funded nuclear power plants is unclear. Party-commissioned modelling suggests the total system cost would be $331 billion over several decades, but Mr Taylor said on Sunday much of the cost would fall on the private sector. In health, the Coalition has matched most new Labor initiatives, including $25 PBS medicines and the new bulk billing incentive. It also proposes to restore the 10 additional Medicare-subsidised therapy sessions that expired under Labor, but it does not have a position on Labor's 50 new urgent care clinics, instead announcing four of its own in marginal seats.

Government has the momentum heading into budget week,"For Labor, the budget is an opportunity to capture voters' attention before the election",2025-03-24 04:37:58,"For months the conventional political wisdom has been that a federal budget must be avoided — because Anthony Albanese's government would have to hand down a deficit and that would serve as a reminder to the public that the country is in structural financial trouble. But we are now in a new paradigm.  The federal budget is on the cusp of being delivered — and the government is holding the talking stick just when it needs it most.  We are in the Theatre of the Absurd — journalists will be locked up for hours on Tuesday to write countless stories about the government's budget two minutes before an election. The budget is therefore almost entirely a manifesto for re-election. This isn't to suggest that there aren't risks for the government in having to publish so much detail about the country's fiscal position. But consider this: the country's entire media establishment is about to be ensconced in writing and broadcasting information about the government's budget and agenda at a time when attention is the commodity all politicians need more of.  With so many soft voters who haven't really made their minds up, attention is of great value right now. Your attention is what they are seeking, and they will be reaching for it everywhere they possibly can in the next week. Chris Hayes, the host of MSNBC's ""All In With Chris Hayes"" in the US, has recently written a fascinating book about the corrosive consequences of the attention economy called ""The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource”.  In it he makes the case that attention is the world’s most valuable resource. And the people who are winning right now (think Donald Trump) deeply understand its value and how to use it.  As the political fight for our attention is what matters most right now, is a budget really the way to do that? Well, no, not on its own. But in the fight for attention, the budget gives the government the best chance of slipping into your limited attention space. Cost of living again ""front and centre"" of budget: Jim Chalmers When Albanese appeared on influencer Abbie Chatfield's podcast for a 90-minute chat, it wasn't just for a soft interview — it was about getting into the social media feeds he would never usually appear in. Go ask any girl in their teens and twenties. Albanese appeared, for the first time ever, in some of their video reels. The power of that cannot be dismissed. The past few weeks have been good for the government — the momentum is finally going their way. It has taken Labor some time to land any punches on Peter Dutton, who has proven to be an underestimated and formidable opponent, capable of switching the conversation into territory he prefers. Peter Dutton's decision to float the idea of holding a national vote on criminal dual citizens has Liberal MPs privately questioning the Coalition's messaging and strategy. Dutton's problem over the past week was by trying to switch the conversation to foreign criminals with dual citizenship, in the absence of context or a genuine crisis, his message fell flat. The Albanese government has often been left flat-footed in the parliament. When Dutton has switched the conversation to national security in the past, it has made the government defensive and worried because they feel it's traditionally uncomfortable territory for them.  But something weird is happening. Some senior Labor figures are actively hoping Dutton uses the week ahead to stray into these areas rather than fearing him as they have in the past. The reason? They are now building a case that Dutton is not ready to govern on the economy and has no cost-of-living solutions.  Their case is made best when the opposition leader strays away from the economy. A senior Coalition source said Dutton must use the opposition leader's budget-reply speech to launch a few new policies. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) All budgets are about expectation management. This year, budget expectations have been set deliberately low — which again favours the government. Will there or won't there be tax relief and who will offer it? Does either side have a plan to get the budget back to surplus? This is as much a test for Dutton as it is for the government. The treasurer might have the talking stick in the next few days, but by Thursday it's the opposition leader who will have it. How he uses it is perhaps his most important moment so far this year. Will he make an economic case, or rely on territory he has visited before? A senior government source said while the government had lost almost every parliamentary week last year, they won the final two and the first two this year, and the week ahead was the most crucial because it was no longer a theoretical contest — time is up. The government will heap pressure on Dutton, framing his Thursday budget reply as not just a speech but a career and election-defining moment. The level of difficulty for Dutton to stay on his preferred ground is huge. Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you. A senior Coalition source said Dutton must use the opposition leader's budget reply speech to launch a few new policies and muddy the waters for Labor leading up to the election. There are other curve balls about to come the government's way, including the Reserve Bank board meeting the following week, which is likely to be the first week of the election campaign.  While the one rate cut undoubtedly improved sentiment around the economy, which helped the government, the Reserve Bank could pour cold water on it this time around. A senior Labor figure said questions remained about how a budget deficit would be received by voters. And if the Reserve Bank board meeting suggested no more rate cuts until September at the earliest, would that take wind out Albanese's sails? There's a few speed bumps coming up for the government to navigate. How they frame them and capture voters' attention will matter most.

"'No ambiguity' on Coalition spending, migration cuts — but no specifics yet","Coalition says 'no ambiguity' it wants to cut spending and migration, but numbers not finalised",2025-03-23 11:25:34,"The Coalition's top economic spokesperson is unable to confirm the size of the opposition's planned public service and migration cuts, the taxpayer cost of building nuclear power plants, or how it would limit government spending. Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor told the ABC's Insiders on Sunday there was ""no ambiguity"" the Coalition would reduce spending growth, migration, the public service, and long-term energy costs. But just weeks out from the federal election, the opposition has yet to finalise specifics for any of these four centrepiece policies, with Mr Taylor suggesting they would be finalised only after Tuesday's federal budget. ""We're making promises we know we can afford, but we're going to see what is in the budget and how much headroom there is,"" he said. Mr Taylor declined to repeat the commitment he made in the wake of last year's budget that the Coalition would cut net migration by 25 per cent. The opposition leader said the Coalition would decide its plans for net migration after the election, contradicting a promise in May to nearly halve the intake. The opposition does plan to cut the number of permanent visas granted each year by 25 per cent, through cuts to the humanitarian program and other migration streams. But there have been mixed signals about its plans for the net figure, which includes temporary entrants such as international students and short-term workers. ""International student numbers have broken all records … We'll put out [our] numbers when we see the budget, but what you can be clear about, no ambiguity about this, is it will be lower under us,"" Mr Taylor said. Net migration has been at the centre of political debate since it exceeded half a million the year after the pandemic. Budget papers include a forecast for the figure, but not ""targets"" since the government does not directly control the size of temporary visa programs. Labor sought to change this by legislating a cap on international student numbers but was forced to find alternatives after the Coalition voted against it. Mr Taylor suggested he was not concerned if Australia's economy contracted after a cut, having been bolstered in recent years from the effects of migration. ""GDP per capita is the number that matters to Australians and it's gone backwards for seven consecutive quarters under this government,"" he said. The shadow treasurer said the Coalition's nuclear policy, which would see several nuclear plants built and owned by the government over the course of decades, would result in a 44 per cent reduction of energy costs over the long term compared to Labor's plans. The federal government will extend its energy bill subsidies until the end of 2025 as it frames its re-election pitch to voters around the cost of living. That figure comes from Coalition-commissioned modelling that Labor contests. The same modelling estimates the total system cost of the Coalition plan would be $331 billion. Mr Taylor said ""a significant portion"" of the cost, including the cost of transmission lines, would be paid for by the private sector. ""Let's be clear, that's not all paid by government. A significant portion will be private sector investment … We'll restrict government's role to what is absolutely necessary, [such as] the seven nuclear generators. ""They'd cost [taxpayers] under $20 billion each. We've been clear about that."" Mr Taylor affirmed the Coalition's intention to return the number of public servants to the levels seen when it was last in office. The Coalition has vowed to cut waste from the government bureaucracy after criticising Labor for growing the public sector. On current numbers, that implies a cut of 36,000 jobs, but Mr Taylor suggested that figure could increase. ""We don't know how many positions Labor has put in place. We'll find out more in the budget. The last number we had was 36,000. It's been growing more, we know that,"" he said. ""What we've been clear about is we want to get back to where we were when we were last in government. That shouldn't be in areas of frontline services. It should be in the back office areas."" Labor's increase to the public service headcount has included new staff to process the backlog of claims in the Department of Veterans' Affairs and new staff at Services Australia. It has also claimed budget savings from shifting work away from external consultants and back to the public service. ""The idea that there are people sitting around in Canberra doing nothing shows how out of touch Peter Dutton is,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Sunday. Mr Taylor said there were ""some amazing people in our public service, but a bigger team is not always a better team"". He also promised the Coalition would introduce a budget rule to limit the rate of government spending growth to no more than the growth rate of the economy. ""It's what we did when we were last in government and it worked,"" he said. The latest budget figures show spending growth of 5.7 per cent in the current financial year, comfortably exceeding that limit, then falling below it for the next three years. The Coalition's finance spokesperson Jane Hume said this would be achieved by taking further steps to limit the cost of fast-growing government spending programs such as the NDIS. ""We would hope that when Labor goes into opposition they would work with us [on further NDIS measures],"" she said in a Sky News interview. Asked whether the Coalition had a specific target for NDIS spending growth, which is currently forecast to be 8 per cent on average over the next decade, she said, ""The most important thing is in the long-term that all government spending doesn't grow faster than the economy itself."" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said that would mean ""huge cuts to the NDIS and that would send a shiver up the spine of people who rely on the program"".  ""We are way too late in the term for those characters to still be making it up as they go along,"" he said. In an ABC interview, Mr Chalmers said Mr Taylor and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton were ""falling apart before our eyes"". ""They either haven't done the work or won't come clean on their secret cuts or both,"" he said. Mr Taylor did not say whether the Coalition planned to increase defence spending.  Mr Chalmers told the ABC Tuesday's budget would not see an increase in the overall level.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-23/coalition-public-service-migration-cuts/105085682

5 Dr James O'Donnell co-authored the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute's 2024 Mapping Social Cohesion report. A demographer at the Australian National University, Dr O'Donnell said social cohesion refers to a sense of well-being, belonging, and a connectedness of society reflected in the trust of government and each other. He said that a decade ago when you asked people how much they agreed or disagreed with the statement that ""Australia is a land of economic opportunity where hard work is rewarded by a better life"", the majority strongly agreed.  That is now down by about 20 per cent. The 2024 study found that financial pressures continue to be a strong drag on social cohesion. In 2024, 41 per cent of adults said they were at best ""just getting along"" financially and 11 per cent described themselves as ""poor"" or struggling to pay bills. Twenty-eight per cent said they often or sometimes could not pay for meals, medicine, or healthcare in the past 12 months, or could not pay their rent or mortgage on time. More than 8,000 people nationally completed a survey for the 2024 study and 45 people took part in an in-depth interview. ""Perhaps above all, in the view of most Australians, economic and cost of living pressures continue to strain household finances and weigh on personal and social wellbeing, trust and acceptance of others, and the sense of fairness and 'the fair go',"" the study found. It was a theme echoed by many of those who contacted ABC's Your Say. Jo Herbig says a holistic approach is needed to ensure a more equitable future for all. (Supplied) ""Intergenerational inequality is an umbrella issue in Australia encompassing many concerns affecting Australians today,"" said Jo Herbig from Brunswick East in Victoria. Increasing burdens of student debt and access to quality education, along with rising housing costs, are key areas of concern for Ms Herbig.  Wealth redistribution through corporate taxation changes and policies to promote affordable housing are potential solutions. ""To reduce intergenerational inequality a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental strategies is necessary to ensure a more equitable future for all Australians,"" Ms Herbig said. For Dr Louise Edwards, a Tasmania-based GP, a key issue is the hidden costs of the housing crisis now and into the future. This includes the impact of housing insecurity on mental and physical health, on educational attainment, and on parenting. ""Generations to come will be affected by the housing crisis through intergenerational epigenetic changes."" Louise Edwards says the housing crisis has a hidden cost on mental and physical health. (Supplied) Dr Edwards said you cannot begin to address people's health needs if they do not have secure housing, and a vision for the future was needed. ""It really deeply concerns me,"" Dr Edwards said of the housing crisis.  ""I am not talking about homelessness here, there are people out there a short step away from losing their home.""

Coalition loses momentum as 'thought bubbles' float into the policy void,"Ready to rumble but halted at the brink, insiders fret as election vibe shifts on Peter Dutton",2025-03-23 04:00:00,"When Norman Mailer landed in Kinshasa to cover the Rumble in the Jungle half a century ago, the great American writer feared for the aging boxer Mohammad Ali's literal life. George Foreman — the fitter, younger opponent — looked lethal. Defeat was ""in the air"", Mailer thought.  But eight days before the fight, Foreman sustained an eye injury while training. The showdown was delayed by five weeks. The pause turned out to matter a great deal. Ali used it to boost his endurance and strength to weather and fatigue Foreman's inevitable heavy blows, like a ""dope on the ropes"". Why Dutton was feeling the pressure this week War scholars have written at length about the effects of deferred combat on soldier morale and motivation. Not everyone masters the struggle with boredom and violence unexpectedly sheathed. Some use a healing hiatus wisely. Others let the doubts creep in. Two weeks ago, as Cyclone Alfred drifted towards Queensland, Anthony Albanese scrapped plans to trigger the campaign for an April 12 election date. We'd be nearing the halfway mark had he stuck to his original plan. Liberal insiders admit the prime minister's decision has disrupted the Coalition's mojo. A 30-day campaign was locked and loaded, every moment planned, with policies to promote and ammunition for Coalition candidates to tear down Labor or teal candidates. Instead Peter Dutton's team are on hold, wondering where to direct their aim. The government, by contrast, is still in charge of all the big levers. ""It's messing with our heads,"" one strategist said. Morale has taken a hit. There's a niggling fear voters are drifting away from Dutton, that he peaked too soon. Peter Dutton's misstep on the referendum is far from fatal but it comes alongside other hints the Coalition's campaign has stumbled in recent weeks. (ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Without a plan of action, the opposition has looked unsure, ill-disciplined and at times downright sloppy. Half-baked ideas have filled the void, such as Dutton's plan to pursue a referendum that would empower politicians to deport Australians who hold citizenship in other countries and commit serious crimes. Costly, unlikely to succeed, it's a solution aimed at a set of real world cases experts say is counted in ""the ones and twos"" per year. Some of the loudest critics were on his own side. Former attorney-general George Brandis called it ""as mad an idea as I have heard in a long time"". The ABC's conversations with almost a dozen senior Coalition figures have revealed widespread frustration and confusion about a referendum some say will take focus away from the cost of living. Liberal campaigners knocking on doors got the same message. ""Every voter we met today is giving us hell on this referendum,"" said one. Dutton's misstep on the referendum is far from fatal. But it comes alongside other hints the Coalition's campaign has stumbled in recent weeks. There have been contradictory statements from shadow frontbenchers on Coalition plans to force insurance companies to split up. Plans to cancel public servant work-from-home entitlements have been partially walked back. There is a lack of clarity over how many public sector jobs will be cut under a future Dutton government. Dutton's biggest pitch to date — the promise to build seven fission reactors — rarely mentions the word nuclear. It has become the energy policy that dare not speak its name. Labor insiders worry that Albanese is not a great campaigner.  (ABC News: Keane Bourke) These factors are becoming apparent in the political tea leaves. Polling shows the opposition leader's head-start over Albanese, for whom there is no great enthusiasm among voters, has waned. Betting odds have narrowed. Two-party preferred surveys have flipped from a Coalition lead to a Labor one. None of which is to say the game is up. Labor has plenty of baggage, including a leader who struggles to cut through, with no real agenda to inspire. Voters are not yet convinced he will change their lives for the better, surveys suggest. Coalition backers are hoping Dutton can turn the tide this week when he delivers the opposition's budget reply speech on Thursday. Many believe the nationally broadcast response is more consequential than Tuesday's budget, where expectations have been managed downwards to near zero. Some opposition figures say Dutton needs a big picture, breakthrough policy that can re-capture the political agenda when the campaign starts, potentially as early as Friday. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers confirms the brief era of budget surpluses will end next week, when he will hand down a budget in deficit. If he doesn't deliver, his own troops may be the first to become anxious. Early voting is set to start in about four weeks from now, so the clock is already ticking. Much can and will no doubt unfold in that time. The Reserve Bank has another interest rate meeting on April 1 and within hours after that Donald Trump is almost certain to unveil a fresh wave of tariffs on Australian exporters. Those wildcards mean the coming contest is very much alive. Former Victorian Liberal Party state deputy director Tony Barry says polls and sentiments are shifting fast at the moment. He has detected sharp reversals in mood across key slices of the electorate — such as outer suburban areas — seemingly off singular events. A radio interview can change the outlook instantly within those groups, he says. Driving this volatility is the huge undecided or ""soft"" vote across the country. Around 47 per cent to 49 per cent of people surveyed have no strong affinity to either side, says Barry, who compares that to the John Howard era when that number was 20 per cent. Even at the recent WA election, which Labor won without raising a sweat, Barry says it came in at 22 per cent in pre-election day polls. Labor insiders worry that Albanese is not a great campaigner.  (ABC News: Keane Bourke) Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Academic research suggests that election battles are not as important to voters as you might think. Most people have made up their mind about who they prefer well in advance. Despite weeks of media coverage, fevered debate and big-dollar advertising campaigns, the average shift in two-party preferred support between polls at the start of hostilities and election day is about 1 percentage point. But when one in two voters need to be pressed hard on who they ""lean"" towards, says Barry, either party could end up winning if they play their cards right. ""The campaign will matter more than normal,"" he says. ""Quite often in campaigns, polls don't move. Last time the only question was 'will the teals win?'"" ""This time, performance, discipline and persuasive messaging will matter."" Labor insiders worry that Albanese is not a great campaigner. His best week during the 2022 race was when he had COVID-19.  But that was the last war. There's a new opposition leader and a different political backdrop. Sportsbet on Friday had the lowest odds for a Labor minority government, paying $2.60. A Coalition minority would win a punter $2.75. The payout for an Albanese outright victory is $6.50. A few weeks ago it was $15. Those are the kind of movements in sentiment that idled political troops can sense in their bones. As Napoleon's maxim goes: ""Morale is to the physical as three is to one."" This mood stuff matters. By this time next week, we'll no doubt find out who best handled the campaign delay.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-23/peter-dutton-coalition-policy-delayed-election-momentum/105078014
Labor promises to shave $150 off energy bills in fresh election pledge,Labor promises to shave $150 off energy bills in fresh election pledge,2025-03-23 10:37:18,"The federal government will extend its energy bill subsidies until the end of 2025 as it frames its re-election pitch to voters around the cost of living. From July 1 every household and about 1 million small businesses will see another $150 in rebates automatically applied to their electricity bills in quarterly instalments. ""This is hip pocket help for households, and it recognises that people are still under pressure,"" Treasurer Jim Chalmers told the ABC. Mr Chalmers could not say when power bills were forecast to fall without taxpayer-funded subsidies and left the door open to extending them further. ""We keep these cost of living measures under more or less constant review, we'll keep that under review from budget to budget,"" he said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the cost of living measure would put downward pressure on inflation.  ""We are going to take a further $150 right off your power bill because helping your family budget is our number one priority,"" Mr Albanese said. Labor had pledged to reduce power bills by $275 a year at the 2022 election, but the average Australian household's energy costs have risen by hundreds of dollars, largely due to the fallout of a global energy crunch raising the prices of coal and gas. The government has denied it amounts to a broken promise, arguing its energy bill relief has had the same effect of lowering household bills. With the federal election expected to be called within weeks, the Albanese government has been under pressure to ease cost-of-living pressures. The Albanese government has been under pressure to ease cost-of-living pressures. (Supplied: stock image) Mr Albanese has named his government's new round of energy rebates as a major reason for voters to reject the Coalition at the ballot box, given the Liberals and Nationals voted against it when parliament approved an initial package of relief at the end of 2022. ""Peter Dutton opposed the $300 energy bill relief to households,"" Mr Albanese said. ""His only plan for energy is a $600 billion nuclear scheme that he will cut Medicare to pay for."" Power prices are set to rise yet again, with the energy market regulator lifting the benchmarks for how much retailers can charge for electricity.  Opposition Leader Peter Dutton had previously criticised the government's use of one-off payments, arguing they could be inflationary and did not resolve the long-term challenges. Mr Dutton repeated that criticism on Sunday, saying the ""fundamentals were broken"". ""This [is a] Ponzi scheme that the government's running where they're pulling money out of your pocket through taxes, and then giving you $150 back and expecting you to say thank you."" But Coalition frontbenchers Angus Taylor, Jane Hume and Nationals Leader David Littleproud all said on Sunday the opposition would support the extension. ""We're not going to stand in the way of Labor cleaning up its own mess. This is a bandaid on a bullet wound here,"" Mr Taylor told the ABC's Insiders. ""We will not stand in the way of that energy relief, but the name of the game has got to be to bring down power prices,"" Senator Hume told Sky. The Coalition will campaign to build a fleet of government-owned nuclear generators across Australia if it wins the election, starting with two plants in 2037 and reaching seven by 2050. Treasury estimates Labor's energy rebate will directly reduce headline inflation by about half of a percentage point in 2025, and reduce household bills by 7.5 per cent on average nationally, compared to bills without the extension. The extension of the rebates will cost taxpayers $1.8 billion over the forward estimates. Asked whether the government has saved any new cost-of-living measures to announce on Tuesday night, Mr Chalmers said voters would ""have to wait and see"" how it all comes together. ""The budget will be all about our progress to here and our plan from here,"" he said. ""The Australian economy is turning a corner; we've made a lot of progress together. And so the budget will be about building on that momentum, providing cost of living help, making the economy more resilient and building Australia's future."" As Mr Chalmers prepares to hand down his fourth budget, most of his colleagues, and opposition MPs, had expected to be two weeks into the election campaign by now. But plans for an April 12 election were thrown into disarray by Cyclone Alfred. Mr Chalmers said the prime minister ""made exactly the right call, for exactly the right reasons"" by delaying the election and suggested the extra two weeks had worked in Labor's favour. ""I think we have seen Peter Dutton and Angus Taylor falling apart before our eyes, they either haven't done the work, or they won't come clean on their secret cuts, or both,"" he said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/labor-promises-to-shave-150-off-energy-bills/105084994
Former addict and advocates want gambling reform discussed before election,"Victoria debates gambling reform, but issue is strangely absent from discussions in federal election lead-up",2025-03-22 07:51:07,"If Victoria had stronger gambling laws, Anna Bardsley feels her life would have turned out very differently.

Anna Bardsley co-founded Gambling Harm Lived Experience Experts to help reduce gambling harm and support those impacted by it. (Supplied: Anna Bardsley) As co-founder of the Gambling Harm Lived Experience Experts, Ms Bardsley says she ""would not have lost 10 years of [her] life"" to gambling if there had been some sort of barrier, such as precommitment cards, to stop her. ""There was nothing to stop me once I was in front of a machine — I just couldn't leave until everything was gone,"" she said. Ms Bardsley said she wanted to see ""some political bravery"" this week as Victorian politicians go to parliament to debate mandatory precommitment cards, a bill the opposition is not backing. A precommitment card requires users — before they play the pokies — to set a limit on how much they are willing to lose. Precommitment cards are already in use at Crown Casino but the Allan Labor government plans to make them mandatory across the state. The proposed bill plans to run a trial in 40 venues for three months, before mandating it on all 26,000 poker machines. The reform will also see the maximum amount of money people can load onto a machine at any time reduced from $1,000 to $100 by the end of 2027. But Ms Bardsley's sights are not just on the state government. Ahead of the federal election, she wants to see both sides of federal politics promising to tackle problem gambling. With the federal election looming, chief advocate with the Alliance for Gambling Reform Tim Costello said he was ""outraged"" by the lack of conversation around gambling reform.

(ABC News: Scott Jewell) ""Nothing has happened to the debate [at a federal level] — both Prime Minister Albanese and Peter Dutton have been captured by the gambling industry,"" Mr Costello said. In June 2023, the ""You win some, you lose more"" report was released with 31 recommendations following the Online Gambling National Inquiry, aka the Murphy Inquiry, led by late Labor MP Peta Murphy. A key recommendation was to introduce a blanket ban on all gambling advertising, a reform the Albanese government vowed to implement. But nearly two years since the inquiry released its findings, Mr Costello said he was ""frustrated … that neither side has even responded to the Murphy report"". ""We are grooming our kids whose heroes play AFL, NRL, or cricket, and literally 80 per cent of those 10-year-old kids know the odds, know the logos, and know the jingles of sport betting companies,"" he said. Mr Costello wants reform over gambling in sport. (AAP: Tracey Nearmy) A federal coalition spokesperson criticised the Labor government for failing to act on recommendations from the inquiry.  ""Labor has been sitting on a report from their own committee inquiry since 2023, yet all they seem to be able to decide on is to wait until after the election,"" the spokesperson said. ""A Coalition government would ensure that families enjoying the broadcast of their favourite sporting event will be protected from gambling ads, which we know cause harm, particularly to children."" A spokesperson for the Albanese government said the government takes its responsibility to protect Australians from the harms of online gambling seriously. ""The government is continuing to work through the 31 recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry into online gambling,"" the spokesperson said. Ms Bardsley said the major parties needed to care ""about the people, not the gambling industry"". ""And I'm not alone.

Greens promise $4b for 'self-defence' missiles in first defence spending policy,Greens policy to make drones and missiles as a 'credible Plan B' to replace AUKUS,2025-03-22 06:18:00,"For the first time in the party's history, the Australian Greens have unveiled a formally costed policy to fund new military programs for locally made ""defensive"" weapons, while also pledging to slash billions of dollars in spending on American technology. Ahead of this year's election, the minor party has unveiled a plan to reallocate $4 billion from savings within the Defence budget towards domestic production capabilities of uncrewed marine and aerial vehicles as well as missiles, strictly for self-defence. Greens Defence spokesman David Shoebridge said his party wants to cancel Australia's $2.4 billion acquisition of M1A2 Abrams tanks and Black Hawk helicopters from the United States, as well as scrapping the $368 billion AUKUS submarine deal. ""We see this as the first step towards creating a credible Plan B when we finally cancel AUKUS — we don't pretend this is the beginning and the end of the significant reorganisation required for Australia's defence force,"" he told the ABC. The Greens want to see the $368 billion AUKUS submarine deal scrapped. (Reuters: Leah Millis) ""We know that this is something Australian industry can deliver over the next four years — it's credible, it's near term and it sends all the right signals to the ADF and our neighbours."" At the last federal election, the Greens sought a blanket reduction in military spending to 1.5 per cent of GDP, but this time the party said it only wants to cut parts of the Defence budget that are wasteful, while reallocating some funds to defend the continent. In the lead up to next week's budget, Labor and the Coalition have traded barbs over defence policy, with the government accusing the opposition of wrongly claiming there had been $80 billion in cuts to military projects. This weekend, Greens leader Adam Bandt will also unveil a policy to create a so-called ""climate army"" to respond to frequent natural disasters, but Senator Shoebridge wouldn't be drawn on whether his defence policy was opposed by some party room members.

""When you're looking at this from a peace and non-violence approach, from how Australia can play a constructive role to ratchet down a regional arms race, one of the first things you need to do is remove us from our dependence on the United States,"" Senator Shoebridge said. ""Now if we're going to make that a reality, that is going to require us having a sovereign capacity to produce some essential defensive weapons on shore — that's also a lesson that's come to us from the Ukraine war. ""Having a sovereign capacity which you can control, which can't be turned off at 24 hours' notice by the likes of Donald Trump, that's actually important for our security.""

Bushland the size of New Zealand to be protected under budget boost,Bushland the size of New Zealand to be protected under federal budget boost,2025-03-22 14:41:25,"Millions of hectares of Australian bushland equivalent to the size of New Zealand will soon be protected under a $250 million budget commitment aimed at meeting the government's goal to conserve 30 per cent of the nation's land. About 30 million hectares of land will gain protected status over the next five years, with the federal government partnering with state and territories, private landholders and First Nations groups on conservation projects. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek told the ABC the cash injection would enable Australia to reach its commitment of conserving 30 per cent of land areas by 2030. ""We know that Australians love their natural environment. They love camping and bushwalking and surfing and swimming and fishing, they love being in the Australian bush,"" Ms Plibersek said. ""We've already added an area around the size of New Zealand to area under conservation in Australia. The funding would expand existing conservation projects, which include partnerships with philanthropic organisations, state and local governments, and establish new Indigenous Protected Areas. In 2022, Australia signed up to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework in Canada, which has a target of protecting at least 30 per cent of land and 30 per cent of our oceans by the end of the decade. The international agreement was adopted as part of a global strategy to prevent and reverse biodiversity loss. Australia has reached 52 per cent protection of ocean territory as marine parks, which Ms Plibersek says exceeds the international oceans goal. But this claim is contested by scientists who argue marine park zones are not fully protected from all activity and that the accurate figure is about 25 per cent. Environmental powerhouse, or toothless tiger? Michael Slezak looks at the impact of a proposed federal regulator, in light of how land clearing is managed in Australia. The most recent official record for protected landmass was 22 per cent. Ms Plibersek said Labor had increased that figure to about 26 per cent since being elected in 2022, although some reserves and projects were yet to be officially declared. Conservationists, including Bush Heritage Australia, have welcomed the announcement, but the organisation's chief executive, Rachel Lowry, told the ABC it wasn't enough. ""It's a really welcome step in the right direction. If we're going to as a nation, honour our commitment to protecting 30 per cent of our landscapes, then we need a fund like this to get us started,"" Ms Lowry said. ""It's going to take a lot more than a $250 million fund to meet the 30 per cent protection target, but it's a start."" The additional funding is just a fraction of the $5 billion green fund the conservation sector proposed in 2023. Ms Plibersek argued the Commonwealth investment would complement state and territory government programs, leverage private investment and attract philanthropic organisations. Jody Gunn, the chief executive of the Australian Land Conservation Alliance, said private landholders can play a major role. ""This is a critical start to safeguard nature for future generations, we have to protect what's left. It's a biodiversity and economic imperative,"" Ms Gunn said. ""More than half of Australia is privately managed … [and] it is home to more than half of Australia's threatened species, so it's an absolutely vital mechanism for protecting nature."" The announcement comes days after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the government would attempt to rush through laws that sideline a separate decision before the environment minister. Ms Plibersek was considering an environmental review into salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour off Tasmania's west coast. But on Thursday the prime minister said the government would legislate laws next week to effectively protect the aquaculture business from a legal battle over the industry's impact on an endangered ray. Anthony Albanese speaks to fish farm workers during a visit to Tasmania in December.  (Supplied: Tassal) Last year, Mr Albanese shelved major reforms to federal environment protection laws after being personally lobbied by WA Premier Roger Cook, who raised concerns it could impede development in the state's mining sector. At the time, Ms Plibersek was on the cusp of striking a deal to pass Labor's so-called nature positive bill in the Senate. The minister would not be drawn on the interventions when asked if the prime minister had put politics over the environment. ""I'm really pleased with the progress we've made in just one term, after a decade of neglect of the environment,"" Ms Plibersek said. ""I'm completely committed to providing better protections for our natural environment and also making faster, clearer decisions for business. ""The environment law … should be designed to do both."" Greens environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young said while the budget boost was welcome, it was just a ""a drop in the ocean"" of what is needed to halt the destruction of forests and wildlife. The Greens Senator also took aim at the government's move to protect Macquarie Harbour salmon farming, which Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has said he would support. ""Sadly, today's announcement is a fig leaf for a government that has consistently backed the big coal and gas mines and the rotting salmon companies at the expense of Mother Nature,"" Ms Hanson-Young said. ""While the environment minister is out announcing limited funding for protected areas, the prime minister is doing deals with the Dutton Coalition to ram through legislation that will trash our environment laws and push ancient marine life to extinction.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/federal-budget-boost-to-conserve-bushland/105081336
Productivity boss warns cutting public service won't save much money,Productivity Commission chair warns cutting public service won't save much money,2025-03-22 05:09:05,"The head of the productivity commission has warned cutting the public service won't save much money and could make reforming the economy more difficult. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has repeatedly criticised the government for expanding the size of the public service by 36,000 places and vowed to cut waste it if he wins the coming federal election. He told Insiders last month that the Coalition would not decide the extent of the cuts until the party was in government, but ""we are not going to have the public service sitting at over 200,000"". The opposition also said its cuts would not apply to ""frontline"" positions. Peter Dutton says government spending is exacerbating inflation. But Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood said if frontline public servants are excluded, the savings won't amount to much. ""In the percentage of government spending, it's small,"" Ms Wood told the Insiders: On Background Podcast. ""It's often a sideshow, I think, those kinds of debates. ""I think as a share of the population, it's actually decreased over 20 years."" Listen: Cut the public service? Productivity commission says think again It's a view shared by economist Steven Hamilton from George Washington University. ""The APS [Australian Public Service] remains a far smaller share of total employment than when John Howard left office in 2007,"" he wrote recently in the Australian Financial Review. He said the cost of public service wages makes up less than 4 per cent of federal spending. Ms Wood also defended the importance of policy experts who aren't on the ""frontline"" when it comes to designing and implementing reforms. ""I'd actually be worried if we were to seriously reduce public service capability, we might reduce the capacity to deliver some of the reforms I'm talking about."" The Productivity Commission is currently working on a major set of economic reform proposals to be unveiled in a draft report after the federal election, due on or before May 17. In December, Treasurer Jim Chalmers asked the commission to conduct five inquiries, focusing on priority areas, including creating a more dynamic and resilient economy, building a skilled workforce, harnessing data and digital technology, delivering quality care, and investing in clean energy. Concerns have grown about Australia's lacklustre productivity performance and the resilience of the economy amid heightened concerns over global volatility since the election of Donald Trump to the White House. Jim Chalmers has asked the Productivity Commission to conduct five inquiries. (ABC News: Mark Moore) Ms Wood said housing would be a key theme in the commission's draft report, to be released mid-year. ""It's a big social issue, but also a big economic issue,"" she said. ""If we don't have places for people to live close to high productivity jobs in our cities, that is a long-term drain on our outcomes. ""We have looked at this question of how do we build more?"" One key finding, Ms Wood said, ""is that we have layered on regulation and made it more complex … across local government, state government, federal government"". The Productivity Commission chair also repeated concerns about the government's ""Future Made in Australia"" plan. While she welcomed the addition of a ""national interest framework"" to the policy, Ms Wood was still critical of ""propping up"" chosen industries with tax credits and incentives when other parts of the economy are struggling to find skilled workers. She also weighed in on the debate over work-from-home rules. While noting some studies have found fully remote work can be bad for productivity, she said a ""well-managed, hybrid"" structure of working two days at home and three days in the office can produce ""slightly positive impacts"".

"Coalition 'flooding the zone' as Trump does, but without as much strategy",The opposition is 'flooding the zone' with foggy ideas instead of focused and disciplined attacks,2025-03-22 05:09:03,"If ""it's the economy, stupid"" was the political strategy phrase most associated with the Clinton White House, ""flood the zone"" is the one most frequently associated with the second Trump presidency. The phrase — as you probably well know by now — was one made famous by strategist Steve Bannon who said five years ago: ""The opposition party is the media. And the media can only — because they're dumb and they're lazy — they can only focus on one thing at a time. ""All we have to do is flood the zone. ""Every day we hit them with three things. They'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done, bang, bang, bang. These guys will never, will never, be able to recover. But we've got to start with muzzle velocity."" Coverage of the chaotic and relentless early days of the Trump presidency has almost been defined by this phrase as the White House has bombarded us with multiple unbelievable stories on any given day. And while it has been fashionable to attribute Trumpian tactics to the federal opposition here in recent times, ""flooding the zone"" is playing out in Australia a little differently. The opposition leader has also escalated his criticism of China in a major foreign policy speech at the Lowy Institute. Think about it: there has been a profound transition from a disciplined focus, for the past three years, on a couple of simple messages from the Coalition (and for that matter the government), on any given day, to a wall of white noise that greets anyone masochistic enough to expose their ears to it. That's partly just part of the process of moving from the ""normal"" part of the political cycle to an ""election"" cycle, when both sides suddenly have lots of messages to impart. On the Coalition side, a relentless attack line on a particular issue (as a format, ""what did the prime minister know and when did he know it, or why didn't he know it"" was always popular), has been replaced by what Anthony Albanese quite rightly described this week as ""thought bubbles"" from the opposition leader and his colleagues. A thought bubble is dropped out in an incomplete and confused way. Then the caravan moves on to another thought bubble the next day, before anyone has got their heads around the first idea, or had time to scrutinise it. The stark difference, though, between how the second Trump White House is ""flooding the zone"" and what the Coalition is doing is that the Trump team know exactly what they are doing.  'Flood the zone' is one of the phrases most frequently associated with the second Trump presidency. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The MAGA forces who had never expected to win in 2016, and therefore came in with not much planned out, inflicted a very different type of chaos on the world to the one we are witnessing this time. As has been well documented, lots of thought has been expended by think tanks and conservative groups in the intervening years about how you go about thoroughly dismantling the machinery of the state in the US. When you think about it in these terms, it only makes more shocking the fact that the Coalition, only weeks now from polling day, hasn't given voters any reason to be confident that it has a coherent set of policies on offer, and is now cannibalising, or tripping over, its own policy positions. A former Coalition strategist observed this week that the current members of the opposition ""lack the strategy, discipline, crispness, dexterity, and indeed clarity to stay on the simple message of cost of living"", and that they were simply re-using the same old strategies and slogans the Coalition has used for the past 20 years ""without understanding why they were formed that way"". Having virtuously attacked Labor for reckless spending for three years, the opposition is now not only matching expensive government spending proposals — like this week's changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme — but adding extra ones on top, like a proposal to boost defence spending from 2 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent — a cost of about $15 billion a year. Not to mention a commitment to a fourth F-35 Squadron (cost $3 billion). (And of course the policy that no longer dare speak its name: the $600 billion nuclear energy policy). The Coalition rails against an increase in income taxes through the life of the Albanese government (even though it had originally planned to oppose the redistribution of scheduled tax cuts last year) and vaguely implies that it might do something about that, but then says it was just pointing out what had happened. And this week there has been the revival of two issues which hit all Dutton's favoured political hotspots: starting with immigration and law and order. Laura Tingle on the politics of migration (Laura Tingle) This is the idea that we should have a referendum on criminals being able to be stripped of their citizenship, and including a question on antisemitism in the citizenship test. Dutton hasn't been very explicit about what he means about a referendum: either in defining the issue, or in clarifying its status as a policy of the Coalition. Peter Dutton's decision to float the idea of holding a national vote on criminal dual citizens has Liberal MPs privately questioning the Coalition's messaging and strategy. At a doorstop interview in Perth on Wednesday, the opposition leader was asked whether he was worried that ""your proposal for a referendum that would allow ministers to deport dual nationals who have committed a crime"" might align him in the public mind too closely with the policies of Donald Trump? ""I want a mandate from the Australian people to be able to implement the laws which are necessary to keep us safe,"" Dutton replied. ""The prime minister dismisses it as a thought bubble. So, we're suggesting here that if we can tighten the laws, we do that. As a last resort, if there's a change to the Constitution required, we can have that discussion."" So Dutton wants the mandate to be able to have a referendum if needed, but not definitely. And he wants a mandate to have a referendum for ""keeping us safe"" without spelling out exactly why it is that he thinks there is a need to change the Constitution. What he is proposing is not, as the average bystander may think, a provision in the Constitution which would simply say ""criminals can be stripped of their citizenship"". For they already can be: but only by courts, using legislation that has already been enacted, not by politicians, or governments. Dual citizens can be deported if they're sentenced to more than three years for a crime like terrorism (though this week Dutton has also added references to paedophiles and something even vaguer about antisemitism) to his description. The strange history of this law and order referendum can be found in Malcolm Turnbull's memoir. (News Video) There is a long, chaotic and sad history on this issue going back to 2015 and the Abbott government, when, as Malcolm Turnbull wrote in his memoir, the then prime minister ""proposed to introduce legislation that would not only give the immigration minister the power to remove the Australian citizenship of dual nationals who fight for terrorist groups but to further give the minister the power to remove the Australian citizenship of people who 'could' become a citizen of another country"". ""No papers were presented to the cabinet to support this,"" he wrote.  Turnbull said there was a ""'telling exchange … when Barnaby [Joyce] said to Dutton, 'If we don't have enough evidence to charge someone with terrorism, how can we have enough evidence to cancel their citizenship?'"" Dutton apparently replied: ""That's the whole point. We don't need as much evidence; it's an administrative decision and we don't have to justify it."" When the debate went public, Tony Abbott accused Labor of ""rolling out the red carpet"" for terrorists to come back to Australia because it was questioning whether a decision to strip citizenship from foreign fighters should be made by a minister without the involvement of the courts. Dutton, then home affairs minister, also accused the Labor party of wanting terrorists to come back to Australia and urged people ""not to get bogged down in detail"".  The government eventually passed laws that gave ministers the right to strip citizenship from criminals if they had been dealt with by the courts, not prospectively if the government 'thought' they were terrorists. But three separate High Court cases have subsequently ruled that while the government of the day could pass laws relating to citizenship, the consequence of stripping someone's citizenship without them facing trial on Australian soil was so serious it should only be handled by a judge. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     It comes down to a question of the separation of powers of the parliament and the courts, and of whether the parliament can overrule the courts. As constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey says, this is a deep and structural question about the Constitution which says that the exclusive power to punish someone should be made by judicial power.  The stripping of citizenship would be a form of punishment which would have to be explicitly set out by the court. Making such a profound change in the balance of power within our institutions would potentially not just apply to questions of citizenship and criminality but could cover a whole range of issues on which executive government could give itself the power to overrule the findings of a court. These are no small matters. But they are not ones you are likely to hear much about, it seems, as the Coalition's ""flooding the zone"" communications roll over continues, as a budget and formal election campaign are about to roll over us. Laura Tingle is 7.30's political editor.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-22/flooding-the-zone-coalition-peter-dutton-referendum-donald-trump/105078038
"Don't demonise asylum seekers, human rights groups warn politicians","Don't demonise asylum seekers, human rights groups warn politicians",2025-03-21 05:18:28,"A coalition of refugee and human rights organisations has written to the leaders of the major parties, urging them to avoid dog-whistling and sowing division throughout the federal election campaign. Anticipating that immigration will be a political flashpoint, the letter — addressed to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, Greens Leader Adam Bandt, and Nationals Leader David Littleproud — calls for respectful public debate. Signed by more than 30 groups, including Amnesty International and the Asylum Seekers Centre, the letter warns against using immigrants and asylum seekers as a political football and urges that these groups be treated with respect. ""Political debate — both during and outside election campaigns — has often seen people seeking asylum become the target of unacceptable rhetoric, often describing refugees and people seeking asylum in a degrading and hostile manner,"" the letter reads. ""This is a poor reflection on how Australia is perceived internationally and undermines our proud record as a truly multicultural nation and as a leader in refugee resettlement and protection principles."" The government proposal is expected to pass through parliament this week with the support of the Coalition. The letter comes as Mr Dutton this week reignited the prospect of holding a referendum to give the government the power to deport dual citizens who commit crimes in Australia. Asylum Seekers Centre CEO Frances Rush described this as an example of ""divisive dog-whistling."" ""If this is the starting mark, we have serious concerns over where the campaign will finish,"" she said. ""These choices have real consequences, real impacts, and real danger for people seeking asylum and refugees. ""We must hold our leaders to account and demand they use their words to create unity, not division."" Refugee Council of Australia CEO Paul Power agreed, saying elected officials and candidates must approach conversations about asylum seekers and refugees with dignity and respect. ""We are a proud multicultural nation with a strong legacy of welcoming refugees and migrants. We ask our leaders to show leadership and compassion — reflecting our core values as a nation — when talking about those who have fled war and persecution in search of a safe place."" With social cohesion emerging as a key concern over the course of this parliamentary term, advocates says politicians need to be extra careful to avoid demonising certain groups and be mindful of the language they use.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/dont-demonise-asylum-seekers-human-rights-groups-warn/105078636
How sought-after Plibersek became persona non grata in a key seat,"Parties unite against US drug makers, a referendum flops and Plibersek won’t help Labor much in Tasmania",2025-03-20 16:32:11,"Welcome back to your weekly federal politics update, where Brett Worthington gets you up to speed on the happenings from Parliament House. Tanya Plibersek has long been one of Labor's most sought after electoral assets.  A darling of the ALP, MPs and candidates fall over themselves to lock in a Plibersek visit, desperate for some of her glow to rub off and boost their electoral fortunes. But a decision taken in the days after the last election will mean one of Labor's most recognisable figures will be nowhere in sight in a seat the government is throwing the kitchen sink at to win.  By merely doing her job, Plibersek has become persona non grata in Tasmania's north-west, where despite a Coalition margin of 8 per cent, the seat of Braddon is very much in play. Arriving at election day in 2022, Plibersek, a former Labor deputy leader, held the education and women's portfolios and had every reason to expect she'd retain them in government. Anthony Albanese's refusal to give Tanya Plibersek the education portfolio could have electoral consequences at the next election.  (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) But the nation's newly sworn in prime minister, who for decades has represented the neighbouring electorate alongside Plibersek, had a different idea.  Try as he might to insist it wasn't a demotion, Anthony Albanese handed what many considered to be a poisoned chalice when he made Plibersek minister for water and the environment. It was quite the combination for an inner-city, Left faction MP whose greatest political threat was always going to come from the Greens. Fast-forward to today and Plibersek finds herself in a government that will next week rush legislation through the parliament that will see her sidelined.  The legislation will effectively override Plibersek's environmental review of the salmon farming to ensure the survival of the industry.  Anthony Albanese has made frequent trips to Braddon to help Anne Urquhart's campaign. (ABC News: Glenn Dickson) The fate of salmon farming has been in doubt since environmental groups asked the minister to review the sector in late 2023. The prime ministerial intervention is not unlike Scott Morrison getting himself sworn into a department to overrule his own minister on the controversial PEP-11 project (minus the whole secret ministries thing).  Albanese, a man desperate to find seats Labor could win, has gone all in on Braddon.  He's convinced a senator to give up a cushy seat in the red room to run and made the calculation that salmon farming equals jobs and jobs equals bolstered electoral fortunes. Plibersek need not worry about not getting a Tasmanian call-up. There is no shortage of other MPs eager for her to visit.  If there was any doubt about the Coalition's concerns about its standing on healthcare policies, you need only look to late Wednesday. So eager was Shadow Health Minister Anne Ruston to match Labor's pledge to cap medications on the pharmaceutical benefit scheme (PBS) at $25 that her commitment came even before the government's policy was public.  Labor released its policy earlier on Wednesday under a strict embargo for 10:30pm that night. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Had the government wanted to surprise the Coalition, it was bitterly disappointed.  Landing in emails at 8:42pm was a press release from Senator Ruston, not under embargo, committing the Coalition to a policy that looked a whole lot like Labor's yet-to-be-announced commitment. Deidre Chambers! Labor has made health a central plank of its re-election bid, regularly framing measures as a pitch to cut household costs.  The scenes that played out on Wednesday were much like those when Labor unveiled an $8.5 billion bulk billing policy and half-a-billion in funding for women's health.  The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a program through which the government subsidises certain medications to make them cheaper for Australians. It's long been targeted by the US pharmaceutical industry, a money-grubbing sector concerned with, shock horror, its own profitability. Enter Donald Trump, who US drugmakers are now lobbying in the hope he will use his favourite word ""tariff"" to target Australia's ""damaging pricing policies"". Mark Butler says Labor will never negotiate with the US over the PBS The attacks have been met with rare bi-partisanship in Canberra, where Labor and the Coalition insist the PBS will not be bargained over in Trump's global trade wars.  There is nothing new about the drug makers' complaints. More than 20 years ago, pharmaceutical giants lobbied against the PBS in Australia-US free trade negotiations.  Like they did decades ago, the government argues the PBS doesn't discriminate between whether the drugs were produced in the US or Australia.  There is some sensitivity for Australia over pharmaceuticals, given they are, along with beef, among Australia's biggest exports to the US.  Trump remains one of the great uncertainties Treasury boffins have had to contend with as they prepare for next week's budget. Treasurer Jim Chalmers this week confirmed the second worst kept secret in town that the budget will be back in the red.  For a time there, some wondered if Labor would eek out a third surplus on the back of high commodity prices, low unemployment and a falling Australian dollar.  At a time of global uncertainty we can be sure Australia is returning to deficit. Gone too is any notion of a typical pre-election cash splash budget. Chalmers insists it will have fewer surprises than usual. The budget on Tuesday, combined with Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's reply on Thursday, will serve as the official end to this parliament. Within days, if not a week, Albanese will then find himself headed to see the governor-general seeking a May 3 or 10 election.  As David Speers notes, both sides will be playing it safe as the spectre of increasing uncertainty looms. Ahead of the budget, Liberals this week found themselves despairing that Dutton found himself advocating for a referendum that was never going to happen. The opposition leader has long wanted the power to strip people of citizenship. The opposition leader vowed he would remember the name of anyone who freelanced on policies. Now, there's one name on the list of offenders — Peter Dutton. As Annabel Crabb detailed last year, the proposal first emerged back in 2015. In a wild cabinet meeting, then PM Tony Abbott shocked colleagues in allowing a six-page discussion paper to be tabled.  He wanted to give Dutton, then the immigration minister, the power to strip Australian citizenship not only from dual nationals accused of terror offences, but also sole Australian citizens, rendering them stateless. Horrified ministers pushed back and Abbott partially backed down. What survived from the policy, the power for a minister to strip dual nationals of their citizenship, ultimately got killed off by the High Court in 2022, with a ruling reminding politicians its for courts, not them, to dish out punishments.  A decade ago, Tony Abbott put forward a plan to give Peter Dutton citizenship stripping powers.  (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) For reasons that still remain unclear, Dutton this week found himself fuelling the prospect of holding a referendum to overcome that. Former attorney-general George Brandis was against the idea when it first came to cabinet in 2015.  A decade later, he dubbed its revival (and referendum chaser) ""as mad an idea as I have heard in a long time"". MPs were so furious they were willing to tell the ABC it was ""insane"" and by Wednesday the Coalition's briefing notes effectively killed it off, not a minute too soon for the Liberals wondering where the cost of living focus had gone.

Dutton confident he can find 'common ground' with Trump,Dutton claims 'common ground' with Trump in major foreign policy speech,2025-03-20 16:30:04,"Peter Dutton says if he wins power he will make his first overseas trip to Washington DC to meet Donald Trump, saying he believes he can find ""common ground"" with the US president. The Opposition leader has made a major foreign policy speech at the Lowy Institute, where he has fiercely criticised the government's handling of ties with Israel and China and the prime minister's openness to sending peace-keepers to Ukraine. Mr Dutton told the institute that if elected he would seek a meeting with Mr Trump in the ""early days"" of his government, and make the case that ""our national interests are our mutual interests"". Australia now goes into an election campaign in which the spectre of Trump, his economically reckless policies at home, and his erratic attempts at foreign policy machismo loom large. He also said he would handle the US president more effectively than Mr Albanese, suggesting he would be able to find some ideological common ground with Mr Trump. ""There is much we have in common to take forward — deregulation, civil nuclear power and most importantly defence — not just AUKUS Pillar One but Pillar Two as well,"" he said. Mr Dutton previously claimed he would have been able to secure an exemption from the global steel and aluminium tariffs that the Trump administration placed on Australia earlier this month. The government ridiculed that claim, pointing out that not a single country managed to win an exemption despite making direct personal appeals to the president. The Opposition leader also used his speech to ratchet up his criticism of Beijing over its decision to send a naval task group to circumnavigate Australia and conduct live fire drills in the Tasman Sea. Mr Dutton called the country's actions an ""obvious show of force"", and said Beijing displayed ""contempt"" to Australia because it failed to provide any advance notice of the exercises — using some of his strongest language on China in months. A series of attacks on Australian political parties on emerging Chinese social media platform RedNote raise concerns about misinformation, disinformation and the risk of foreign interference ahead of the federal election. The Opposition has been intent on rebuilding the Coalition's ties with Chinese Australians. Mr Dutton praised the diaspora during his speech but said the government shouldn't remain ""silent"" when Beijing behaved poorly. ""I do want to see the trading relationship prosper and expand … but we just had a circumnavigation of our country, which has significant consequences for our own outlook on the region and what that means for our national security interests,"" he said. The prime minister and foreign minister criticised China for failing to provide notice for the live fire drills near Australia, but repeatedly emphasised that the Chinese navy had not broken international law. But Mr Dutton called it the ""weakest, most limp-wristed response you could see from a leader"" and said Mr Albanese risked inviting further aggression. ""What was being tested was our response time, how we'd engage, what we'd say [in response] and I think frankly the prime minister has failed every one of those tests."" Asked on the ABC's Afternoon Briefing about Mr Dutton's use of the phrase ""limp-wristed"", which can have homophobic connotations, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said ""this is a bloke who opposed marriage equality, it's an unsurprising use of language from him."" A spokesperson for the opposition leader said ""it was a phrase that shouldn't have been used, and no offence was intended from Mr Dutton."" Mr Dutton also stepped up his criticism of Mr Albanese's statement that he would be open to sending Australian troops to Ukraine if there was a peace deal that allows an international group of peacekeepers into the country to help maintain stability. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will join a phone hook-up tomorrow night to discuss a possible joint peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Mr Dutton said contributing to that effort could draw critical defence resources from Australia's priorities in the region. ""We are a middle power and we don't have an ability to have a presence in multiple theatres, that much is obvious,"" he said. ""It's ill-defined, the Europeans haven't yet made commitments or undertakings that are firm, and there is no peace. ""I think the prime minister wanted to project strength and look strong … but I don't believe we should be out ahead of where the Europeans are in relation to a border presence with Russia where there is no United States assurance about providing … a response."" Former spy chief Dennis Richardson told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing a peacekeeping contribution was ""absolutely what we must do."" ""We should never forget that Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked. Putin does not believe Ukraine has a right to exist. Eighteen months ago some of the people who now say we shouldn't be making a contribution to a peacekeeping force were arguing the Australian government should be doing more to help Ukraine. ""If there's a peace agreement, and there's peacekeepers sitting behind that, and that's all agreed as part of a settlement, why wouldn't we take part in that? It wouldn't involve combat troops on the ground, I don't believe... It would not involve many people, and it would not at all compromise our own engagement in the region... ""We would have no pride in ourselves and no sense of priority if we weren't prepared to consider that."" Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Afternoon Briefing there were ""a lot of hypotheticals... and a lot of ifs [but] we have an interest in supporting Ukraine... Peter Dutton, where he has a choice, back Australia or pick a political fight, he always chooses picking the political fight."" The Opposition leader was repeatedly interrupted at the beginning of his speech by two climate protesters from the environmental group Rising Tide, who took aim at his policies on nuclear power. One of the protesters accused Mr Dutton of ""lying to the Australian people about the cost of nuclear"" before being escorted out of the room. The second protester was also forced out of the room by a security team member after standing up to criticise Mr Dutton.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/dutton-confident-of-common-ground-with-trump/105076752
A deepfake Dutton speaks Mandarin on Chinese social media platform,Chinese social media platform RedNote fuels misinformation concerns in Australian election,2025-03-20 14:53:27,"阅读中文版 A series of attacks on Australian political parties on emerging Chinese social media platform RedNote (RED), has raised concerns about misinformation, disinformation and the risk of foreign interference ahead of the federal election. Among the most notable is an AI-generated deepfake video of Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, falsely depicting him speaking Mandarin, and a misleadingly edited video suggesting he intends to deport Chinese Australians. The Albanese government has also been targeted, including with posts showing people being arrested in shopping centres, accompanied by the false claim that Australian police are arresting temporary migrants. Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. The vertical video platform, also known by its Chinese name Xiaohongshu, which means ""little red book"", was designed for lifestyle content and e-commerce and has expanded rapidly, now attracting over 700,000 monthly users in Australia. Analysts say its increasing influence and unique algorithm that makes it easy to share misinformation make it a key platform to watch in the lead-up to the election. However, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is not monitoring the platform for misleading or deceptive content. A dossier of attacks on Australian political parties has been compiled by the RECapture project, an initiative of several Victorian universities that analyses how Australia is portrayed across Chinese social media services. Between November and February, its researchers found misleading content on RED targeting both major parties as well as independent candidates. Peter Dutton has been one of the main targets of attacks, with misleading claims circulating about his policies on nuclear energy, immigration, housing and health care. The ABC has also discovered additional posts. They include one video clip based on an interview Mr Dutton gave explaining his policy to not display Indigenous flags alongside the Australian flag at press conferences. ""We are a country united under one flag. If we are asking people to identify under different flags, no other country does that,"" Mr Dutton said in the interview. But the AI-generated clip on RED portrayed Mr Dutton speaking in fluent Mandarin — with his own voice. It added the false commentary: ""Peter Dutton vows to abolish the Aboriginal flag if he's elected."" A video featuring AI-generated audio of Peter Dutton speaking Mandarin posted to RedNote. Another post discovered by the ABC falsely claimed Mr Dutton had compared international students to ""modern-day refugees who stow away on boats"". Yet another post falsely alleged that Mr Dutton ""told Chinese Australians to leave the country"", heavily distorting a speech he gave last year. The original speech was criticising participants in an anti-Israel protest at the Sydney Opera House in 2023. ""My message to this recalcitrant minority is simple. You will not change us. If you do not subscribe to the Australian way of life, leave this country,"" the opposition leader said in the speech, delivered in April 2024. However, the post on RED misleadingly suggested that Mr Dutton was talking about Chinese migrants, who he planned to deport if elected. The person who posted the video commented on the post, claiming it meant: ""If Australian Chinese don't assimilate and become 'bananas', they risk being expelled from Australia soon."" ""Banana"" is a racial slur aimed at Asian people, implying that they are yellow (Asian) on the outside but white on the inside. Remarks Peter Dutton made last year were misleadlingly presented in a video posted to RedNote. The ABC has identified the poster as a mortgage broker based between China and Sydney. He did not respond to questions about why he was posting misleading claims about Mr Dutton. In other examples of misinformation, a scare campaign targeting Mr Dutton's Medicare policies, promoted by Labor and reported by the ABC, has also continued to spread on RED. Labor has attacked Mr Dutton's Medicare record in official campaign ads authorised by Health Minister Mark Butler and Foreign Minister Penny Wong. However, unauthorised versions of these political posts have spread on RED without proper disclosure. The researchers have also found misinformation posts criticising Labor policies, including one that alleged Australia's improved diplomatic ties with India would lead to an influx of Indian migrants, increasing competition with Chinese migrants in the housing market. The AEC told the ABC it was aware of the rise of political misinformation on RED but was not proactively monitoring the platform. ""If we receive information about unauthorised content on the channel, we will have a look at it and if it requires action, we will take it. This is the standard approach we take across all social media platforms,"" an AEC spokesperson said. The University of Melbourne's Yang Fan, a lead researcher with the RECapture project, said political information spread far more easily on RED than on the more established Chinese social media platform, WeChat. While WeChat remained the most popular platform for Chinese Australian voters to receive information, much of its political content is confined to closed groups or official accounts. In contrast, RED allowed campaign material developed on other platforms to be easily reshared. ""The accessibility of RED, compared to WeChat, makes it a key platform for political communication,"" Dr Yang said, adding that its algorithm actively pushed political content to potential voters based on shared demographics, location, browsing history and interests. Dr Yang Fan says RED can amplify extreme views. (Supplied, file photo) Robbie Fordyce of Monash University, another lead researcher on the project, said that RED's algorithm, which prioritised engagement and clickbait-style content, could amplify extreme views. ""One of the issues we see on RED is that it becomes a space where people's anxieties are heard and targeted,"" Dr Fordyce said. ""And we don't give enough credit to the degree to which people are prepared to recirculate misinformation because they're scared."" Although it is difficult to track the exact reach of a RED post, some misleading posts have been liked and shared hundreds of times. Tracing the origins of misinformation and disinformation on RED is difficult. Many accounts spreading misleading claims about Australian politics are based overseas, particularly in China, according to data collected by the Melbourne-based researchers. Dr Yang said there was little transparency regarding account verification on RED, making it harder to track sources and motivations. She said it was impossible to even determine whether a given account was operated by a single individual or an organisation. Please use this form to get in contact with the ABC Investigations team, or if you require more secure communication, please choose an option on the confidential tips page. Concerns are also growing over coordinated disinformation campaigns and the anonymous accounts behind them. Senator James Paterson said it was ""'critical"" for Australia to monitor disinformation. (ABC News: Matt Roberts, file photo) In 2023, a Senate inquiry into foreign interference raised concerns that social media platforms could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation to influence political outcomes in Australia, manipulate community discourse and understanding about an issue or spread chaos and seed distrust in Australia's democratic systems. Liberal senator James Paterson, who chaired the inquiry, said it was ""critical"" for Australians to stay on top of the issue. ""We know that authoritarian states are particularly adept at using a range of means, including social media, to try and influence political outcomes,"" Senator Paterson said. Dr Fordyce said the RECapture team had not found any clear evidence of a state-sponsored coordinated campaign via RED. ""We did spend some time trying to see if we could detect clear evidence of any international actors … trying to sway public opinion on these platforms in Australia — we did not find any evidence of that,"" he said. ""That's not to say it didn't happen, but we just didn't see anything there, even though we were looking for it."" Australian politicians have been using RED to promote their election campaigns and reach Chinese Australian voters. Although they make up just 5.5 per cent of the Australian population, a significant proportion of Chinese Australian voters reside in marginal seats. But the ABC can confirm both Labor, Liberal and independent candidates have been ""shadow banned"" by the platform, meaning the account remains active but users cannot search for the profile. A video posted to RedNote by Labor featuring several of its candidates. (RedNote) Dr Fordyce described this as a part of a general move by social platforms to crack down on political campaigning. The result is that official accounts of the candidates are harder to access, yet unofficial material, including misinformation or disinformation, remains freely available. Dr Yang said RED did not attempt to identify misleading political content. ""If someone is discussing Australian policies, RED does not actively verify or patrol the content. It is considered opinion, and people are free to have opinions,"" Dr Yang said. Currently, Dr Yang says the onus is on Chinese Australian voters, many of whom lack the media literacy skills needed to critically assess online information. This meant verifying information could be ""extremely emotionally taxing and draining,"" she said. A 2022 Lowy Institute report found that a quarter of Chinese Australians encountered ""made-up news"" during the last federal election, but only half took steps to verify the information. Dr Fordyce says misinformation in Chinese is hard to debunk because the alternative perspectives, facts or opinions are often in English. The researchers argue the AEC needs to start policing the platform. ""We have been advocating for more official voices for a long time. Our research shows that misinformation narratives repeat in every electoral cycle and major political event,"" Dr Yang said. An AEC spokesperson said: ""While the AEC does not have a presence on Xiaohongshu [RED], we are constantly monitoring the social media environment with an eye to ensuring that we are communicating with as many voters as possible within our finite resources."" The spokesperson said resources from its Stop and Consider digital literacy campaign were available in multiple languages on its website.

Dutton won't need help identifying MP breaking his pre-election edict,"Peter Dutton made a pre-election cost of living edict, only to find himself repeatedly breaking it",2025-03-19 14:46:18,"Peter Dutton won't need any help to spell the name of the politician who's repeatedly broken his pre-election edict.  Addressing his cabinet and caucus when parliament resumed last month, he reportedly made it clear he was keeping a close eye on his team. Politicians left the private meetings with no doubt. There was to be no freelancing. Now was not the time for culture wars. Dutton wanted a laser focus on cost of living. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington If politicians stepped out of line, he would remember when it came time to dishing out the spoils of an election win.  More than a month on, there's been a repeat offender, who has found themselves caught up in no shortage of distractions.  At the top of his list sits one name: Peter Dutton.  For almost three years, Dutton had an unrivalled run for a first-term opposition leader. Once Labor's honeymoon period waned, he killed off the Voice, capitalised on inflation and a made the most from a High Court ruling on immigration that caught the government flat-footed. Dutton so successfully had the government on the defensive that he entered this year with growing expectations that he was on track to defy history and turn Labor into a one-term government. For nearly three years now, Peter Dutton has deployed — with considerable success — one of the few orthodox political tactics which remains a good bet even in these strange times: Set expectations low and clear them with ease. Months on, there are concerns within Liberal ranks that the wheels might be getting wobbly, if not coming off entirely.  There's no one moment when things took a turn. If anything, it's the sum of the parts.  Dutton had his first taste of pre-election scrutiny when Labor dropped a dirt sheet on his pre-bank bailout share spending spree.  The release of policies to offer tax-free lunches and to end work-from-home provisions for public servants also faced heightened scrutiny, and ultimately prompted the party to soften its initial stances. Even messier was a captain's call over carving up the big insurers, which has repeatedly been rebuked by some of his most senior frontbenchers.  All of this was before Dutton went to ground after it emerged he'd left his electorate, which was sandbagging ahead of the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, to attend a harbourside Liberal fundraiser in Sydney.  That brings us to this week, when Dutton dug deep into his political playbook and flicked the switch to national security.  National security has long been the policy of choice the Coalition turns to when things get tough politically. It's usually viewed as a political strong suit, unless you find yourself advocating for a referendum that is never going to happen.  Forget what Labor thinks about Dutton's desire to gain unconstrained powers that currently only rest with the courts, his own side of politics have dubbed ministerial citizenship stripping ""insane"". Peter Dutton's decision to float the idea of holding a national vote on criminal dual citizens has Liberal MPs privately questioning the Coalition's messaging and strategy. Remember, this from a man who during the Voice debate said a referendum was a waste of money, only to promise to hold another one on Indigenous recognition and then abandon the idea weeks later. A year later he's be starting another culture war when he vowed he wouldn't stand beside Indigenous flags at press events.  As was the case with breaking up the insurers, frontbenchers were out hosing it down almost as soon as Dutton again put voice to the proposal, which would create a two-tier criminal justice system.  Others, much like Dutton when the fundraiser revelation emerged, went to ground, suddenly unavailable for TV and radio interviews. By Wednesday, the proposal was dead, with the ABC's Olivia Caisley revealing the Coalition's official talking points making clear ""there's no plans to hold a referendum"". ""If we're presenting ourselves as an alternative government, we should be a lot more disciplined in articulating policy ideas,"" a Liberal MP offered.  Being opposition leader, you're not accountable for pretty much anything. One of the few joys of the job is you can lob grenades at those who are responsible.  It's why as opposition leader, Anthony Albanese would repeatedly say ""I'm not the government"" or ""we're not the government"".  It doesn't cut it as the election approaches. Dutton knew that when he was addressing his partyroom earlier this year.  Peter Dutton used his first address to Coalition politicians this year to reinforce the need to campaign on the cost of living.  (ABC News: Mark Moore ) At the time, the opposition leader, like most political observers, thought it would be the last time he would be rallying his troops ahead of the election. As it's turned out, he'll get another chance when the parliament returns for a pre-election budget.  There are no shortage of Liberals desperately hoping he'll find himself suddenly finding his own cost of living edict.

Coalition MPs told to hose down Dutton's dual national referendum idea,Coalition MPs told to hose down prospect of referendum on criminal dual nationals,2025-03-19 11:52:20,"Coalition MPs have been told to hose down the prospect of a national vote on changing the constitution to deport criminal dual citizens, with today's official talking points reiterating ""there's no plans to hold a referendum"". The opposition leader's decision to float the issue has led to Liberal MPs privately questioning the Coalition's messaging and strategy on the eve of a federal election. Less than 12 hours after Opposition Leader Peter Dutton doubled down on his plan to potentially change the constitution to allow politicians to strip dual nationals convicted of crimes of their citizenship, Liberal sources told the ABC they had been advised they should not advance the referendum idea in interviews. The ABC's conversations with almost a dozen senior Coalition figures have revealed widespread frustration and confusion about a referendum some say will take focus away from the cost of living. ""All options are on the table, there are no plans to hold a referendum at this stage,"" the talking points say. Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor on Wednesday insisted sending Australians to the polls for another referendum was ""not our policy"". But Mr Dutton defended his earlier comments during a media conference in Perth on Wednesday, telling reporters he will ""do whatever it takes to … keep our country safe"". ""We're suggesting here that if we can tighten the laws, we do that,"" he said. ""As a last resort, if there's a change to the constitution required, we can have that conversation."" The idea to give unconstrained power to politicians to deport criminals who are dual nationals was first floated by the opposition leader weeks ago. However it has been thrust back in the spotlight after an article in the Nine newspapers. Liberal MPs told the ABC that Cyclone Alfred had taken the wind out of the Coalition's sails, with widespread expectation they would be in the throes of an election campaign now. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese again rubbished the proposal as a thought bubble on Wednesday, with one Liberal MP conceding it was a mistake that ""hadn't been thought through"". ""We've already established our credentials in national security. We don't need to be doing anything more in this space,"" a Liberal MP said. ""If we're presenting ourselves as an alternative government, we should be a lot more disciplined in articulating policy ideas."" Another agreed there had been inconsistency in the opposition's messaging in recent weeks, with different views or policy positions being articulated by different shadow ministers. ""We need to revisit how messages flow. The system in place needs revision, especially as policy begins to dribble out over the next few weeks,"" they said. The source said the Coalition had effectively been in a ""twilight zone"" in which it was oscillating between being in campaign mode or opposition mode. Despite this, they believe next week's parliamentary sitting and federal budget will be a moment to regain momentum and get back on message, with MPs and senators in the same building and not dispersed across the country.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/coalition-mps-hose-down-dutton-referendum/105070638
Dutton's 'insane' referendum leaves some Liberals fuming,Dutton citizenship referendum proposal leaves some Liberals fuming,2025-03-19 10:54:33,"A group of Liberal MPs, campaigners and a former minister have privately and publicly criticised Peter Dutton's suggestion there needs to be a national referendum that would grant politicians unconstrained power to deport criminals who are dual nationals. The opposition leader's push — which came a day after the Coalition sought to renew pressure on Labor over claims of ongoing CFMEU bullying on construction sites — surprised many inside opposition ranks, some of whom said they first learnt about the plan via a newspaper report. Mr Dutton on Tuesday confirmed a story in Nine newspapers that he was considering whether to ask voters to change the constitution in order to ""keep our country safe"". ""My argument is if you betray your allegiance to our country in that way, you should expect to lose your citizenship,"" Mr Dutton said. ""What we're proposing here is a discussion about whether we've got adequate laws, about whether the constitution is restrictive"". Mr Dutton's ploy, which was downplayed by shadow attorney-general Michaelia Cash as a ""last resort"", is being interpreted by some inside the Coalition as a ""political circuit breaker"" following several weeks of ""lost momentum"" against Labor in polls. Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor told ABC Radio National a referendum was ""not our policy at this point in time, it is an option, and all options are on the table"". However, there is also dismay that Mr Dutton would now seek to promote a referendum having spent the last two years berating Labor for its Voice campaign and for failing to focus on cost-of-living concerns, the ABC has learned after conversations with almost a dozen senior Coalition figures. They said the opposition leader successfully made referendum a ""dirty word"", synonymous with distracted government. ""We need to be focused on the cost of living and not hypothetical changes to the constitution,"" said one MP. Having castigated Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for spending an estimated $450 million on his referendum, it made no sense to trigger another vote on an issue that relates to a handful of cases, an MP said. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has doubled down on his proposal to hold a referendum to change the constitution to allow citizenship to be stripped from dual nationals who break the law. ""It's insane, and none of us were told about this,"" said one Liberal figure. Another said the hard-line stance on giving politicians the power to remove citizens from the country contradicted the Liberal Party's strategy of ""softening"" Mr Dutton's image to broaden his appeal. There is also unease that pushing for a referendum on deporting Australians who are citizens in another country would quickly morph into an ugly row. ""Before you know it we'll be in a debate about dual citizenship. But that's who we are as a nation,"" said one MP. Others downplayed the proposal's significance, saying it was an old issue raised by the opposition leader weeks ago and that reaction to the story was ""overblown"". Shadow trade minister Kevin Hogan defended the need to obtain the power to send Australians to another country. ""If there is one person in this country that's happy to blow people up and kill Australian citizens, it's one too many but there's more than that,"" Mr Hogan told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing. By contrast, former Coalition government attorney-general George Brandis condemned Mr Dutton's move, calling it as ""mad an idea as I have heard in a long time"". ""After the emphatic defeat of the Voice in 2023, one would have thought the last thing Australians want from the next parliament is the distraction of yet another ideologically inspired constitutional referendum,"" Mr Brandis wrote in an opinion piece for Nine newspapers. ""If it is indeed under consideration, that consideration should stop right now."" First raised within the Coalition under Tony Abbott in 2015, the notion of changing the constitution to deport dual citizens would almost certainly fail, Mr Brandis said. Former Attorney-General George Brandis said the referendum idea was ""mad"". (AAP: Lukas Coch) Former top immigration official Abul Rizvi said there was already an existing 2023 power for ministers to request courts to strip criminals of citizenship. ""[The] referendum question [would be] fundamentally 'do you agree that the power to strip Australians of citizenship should be transferred from judges to politicians?',"" Mr Rizvi said. ""That's essentially asking Australians who do you trust more? Judges or politicians? Why the hell would a politician bother asking that question?"" Mr Rizvi accused Mr Dutton of dog whistling rather than ""actually making any constitutional change"". Coalition sources noted that history suggests referendums only succeed if they have bipartisan support, and they almost always require a large majority of support well before campaigning over the question begins. At the start of 2023, Labor's proposal to legislate a Voice to Parliament was backed by more than three out of every five voters, according to opinion polls. That lead dwindled as the No campaign gathered momentum, resulting in an overwhelming defeat for the Yes movement. Mr Albanese said the proposal was ""another thought bubble from Peter Dutton that has not made it to lunchtime."" ""This has not been thought through. It is not clear where this has come from. Peter Dutton wants to talk about anything but the cost of living.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/dutton-citizenship-referendum-leaves-liberals-fuming/105068674
"Sub-zero popularity aside, many voters don't even recognise this leader","Many Greens voters don't know who their leader Adam Bandt is, but that might not be a problem",2025-03-19 04:00:00,"Last month, the research firm Redbridge asked voters in 20 key federal seats for their broad views on party leaders Anthony Albanese, Peter Dutton and Adam Bandt. As you would expect in the nation's current cheesed-off state of mind, all three men enjoyed sub-zero popularity among respondents. Everyone hates everything right now, especially if it's anywhere near politics. The PM's net approval rating was minus 16, Dutton's minus 11, and the Greens leader was minus 23. None of this is particularly surprising. But here's something that might surprise you. Twenty-five per cent of respondents — when asked their opinions of Adam Bandt — said they'd never heard of him. And — stranger still — this rate of non-recognition was highest among respondents planning to vote Green. Thirty-one per cent of Greens voters had never heard of the Melbourne MP who has led their preferred party for five years, compared with just 23 per cent of Labor voters and 22 per cent of Coalition voters for whom Bandt's name did not ring a bell. In fact, Adam Bandt's name recognition was strongest among the people least likely to vote for him, and weakest among the voters most firmly in his party's sights. He's best-known among the over-65s, among people who own their houses outright and among those who describe themselves as being under no financial stress. But Bandt draws the biggest blank among renters (33 per cent), young people (39 per cent), and people describing themselves as under a ""great deal"" of financial stress. That doesn't mean these voters aren't planning to vote Green. They are: The very same research confirms that approval of the Greens remains strongest among those who rent, are aged between 18 and 24, and/or live in households earning less than $1,000 a week. Interview with Greens Leader Adam Bandt What can be made of these baffling results? Basically, it's a clear (and possibly, for Bandt, bordering-on-brutal) demonstration of two modern realities. The first is that the success of the Greens has very little to do with who the leader is, and everything to do with brand identification. Unlike the major parties, where leadership challenges can engender rapid reversals of direction, the Greens tend to chug along fairly consistently regardless of who's ""in charge"" of their party room, which in any event makes decisions ""by consensus"", which is Greenspeak for ""meetings that are courteous and go for longer than the average carbon-based-life-form's tolerance for being in a meeting stocked only with wholegrain snacks"". In fact, after the 2010 election, when South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson Young mounted a challenge to the party's then-deputy Christine Milne, nobody found out about it for several weeks, and even then the story only emerged because Bob Brown casually mentioned the incident during a press conference about something else. The Greens are a party whose purpose is written on the tin. It's branding genius, actually: If you care about the environment, vote Green. The colour of trees. Simple! The second take-out from the Redbridge research is that — among younger voters especially — disengagement from the details of politics is incredibly high. The 2025 election — as the ABC's Patricia Karvelas wrote last year — will be the first at which Millennial and Generation Z voters outnumber Baby Boomers. The era of Baby Boomers as the dominant voting force in Australian politics is at an end and the impact will play out at the next federal election. If you listen carefully, you can already hear that politicians know the power and numbers have shifted to younger people. Redbridge principal Tony Barry says that among younger voters, media consumption patterns are highly fragmented, and disengagement from politics is common. ""This is underpinned by their assessment that political parties are no longer personally relevant to them because they are perceived not to be offering any solutions to salient issues,"" he says. ""The media diets of older voters continue to be over-indexed by legacy media."" Why are older, wealthier, home-owning, major-party-supporting people simultaneously more likely to have heard of Adam Bandt, and less likely to vote for him? Because they're also more likely to watch the news on TV or read newspapers, or follow politics in some kind of linear way, which younger voters most certainly do not. And Bandt — whose party plagues both Albanese and Dutton, but usually for different reasons — has the distinction of regular name-checks on both Sky News and The Guardian, two outlets whose only common feature is their membership of a legacy media contingent whose rusted-on consumers skew older. When a growing number of young or busy or disengaged voters don't go in search of political news, it forces politicians at election time to go and plonk themselves down where these voters are gathering to do entirely unrelated stuff. This is why Opposition Leader Peter Dutton — who last year called for the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok to be banned — now posts there with enthusiasm. ABC News Verify investigates social media performances of political parties It's why the PM and the opposition leader are both finding time in their diaries for long interviews with popular podcasts: Mamamia's Kate Langbroek interviewed them separately in episodes dropped simultaneously at the weekend, while the PM and Greens leader have both appeared on influencer Abbie Chatfield's podcast. Bandt also made his debut as a DJ at a live event with Chatfield in his seat of Melbourne, where his name recognition appears to be solid. According to a Herald Sun poll published this week, Bandt enjoys a primary vote of 50.1 per cent in the inner-city seat, which for more than a century elected only Labor MPs. The same poll — commissioned by the conservative campaign group Advance — had mixed news for Bandt's colleagues Max Chandler-Mather, Stephen Bates and Elizabeth Watson-Brown, who sensationally won three lower house seats in Brisbane in the 2022 election's turbulent elimination of the Morrison government. While Chandler-Mather was positioned to hold on, the Herald Sun reported that Bates and Watson-Brown were likely to succumb (though both poll and analysis are disputed by Queensland Greens). Public polling consistently puts The Greens' national support at around 12 per cent — the same as it was in 2022. That's enough to secure a strong result in the Senate, but to win in the lower house, a much higher primary vote is needed. Typically, in lower house seats, Greens candidates tend to be eliminated and their preferences go towards electing Labor candidates. This is how it is possible for Labor to hold 51 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives, despite commanding less than 33 per cent of the primary vote. The Greens' 12 per cent primary vote in 2022, by contrast, won only 2.5 per cent of the seats — and that was their best result ever. That's our preferential voting system in action: at present, it helps Labor. And winning all four of those seats again this time is a different proposition. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Crossbench parties and independents work and campaign in different ways, depending on what flavour of government is in power. In a Kitchen Cabinet interview in 2012, Greens leader Christine Milne made a kind of fascinating observation. She said that the Greens were best-positioned — in her experience — when they held the Senate balance of power under a conservative government. ""When Labor's in opposition, it is a lot more true to its principles than it is in government,"" she said, arguing that in such circumstances Labor was more prepared to team up with the Greens to push for environmental outcomes. ""When Labor is in government, the exact opposite happens. Because the Liberals are pushing in the opposite direction, Labor is afraid to deliver with the Greens on a progressive policy agenda because the Liberals keep accusing them of just doing as the Greens want, so the result of that is that they go further and further to the right."" Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Campaigning is different, too. Winning as a Green in the lower house as part of a protest vote against a conservative, coal-fancying government in 2022 is one thing. Holding on in 2025 when the incumbent government is committed to an aggressive renewable energy rollout may well be another, which explains why the Greens have spent the past three years diversifying into housing policy, advocacy for Palestine, and — as Bandt did on Sunday — demanding that Australia abandon the AUKUS alliance. Will it be enough — in each of those seats, and in the Labor-held Victorian seats of Macnamara and Wills, which also are in the Greens' crosshairs — to lift the Greens contenders past the benchmark ""brand awareness"" of 12 per cent and into active contention? Albanese — consistent with Milne's analysis — has ruled out the kind of formal deal that prime minister Julia Gillard signed with the Greens after the 2010 election. The resultant wattle-besprigged signing ceremony is now broadly regretted in Labor ranks, as it allowed opposition leader Tony Abbott to paint Gillard as a dangerous left-winger. And the whole deal and signing ceremony only won Labor one extra vote: the lone vote of the single Greens candidate who'd managed to win a lower house seat. Chap by the name of Adam Bandt. Perhaps you've heard of him?",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/adam-bandt-greens-vote-federal-election/105067990
Dutton vows fast-track approval for Woodside's gas behemoth,Dutton vows fast-track approval for Woodside's North West Shelf gas behemoth,2025-03-18 21:30:19,"Woodside's vast plan to extend its North West Shelf gas plant until 2070 would win a federal go-ahead within 30 days of a Peter Dutton election victory, as the Coalition pledges to limit the ability of protest groups to stymie environmental approvals. The Coalition leader will announce a proposal for ""fast tracking"" of the WA project in Perth on Wednesday, which would also pave the way for a $30 billion Browse joint venture with Woodside, BP and Japanese giant Mitsui. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek last month delayed a federal government deadline to the end of March on whether to green-light the project. Her move effectively shifted her decision on the controversial development beyond this month's WA state election, which Labor won easily. WA's Environment Minister Reece Whiby approves a 50-year extension of a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project following a six-year approvals process. The WA government approved Woodside's plan in December, six years after it was first announced and after a series of long-running protests and appeals by climate groups opposed to new fossil fuel projects. A Dutton government would declare the North West Shelf project to be in the ""national interest"" under federal environmental law in a move the Coalition says will contrast to Labor's hesitancy on the project. ""We would expedite consideration of the North West Shelf project as a matter of urgency because, unlike Labor, we recognise the significance of the North West Shelf to the WA economy and the importance of secure and reliable gas supplies in pushing down energy prices,"" Mr Dutton will say. ""It is of national importance that this project not be held up any longer by a government whose prime minister and minister would rather gain Green votes in inner-city electorates than approve good economic projects for the energy security of our nation."" With an election due in May, the Albanese government has until March 31 to announce whether it will allow Woodside to run its Burrup Peninsula plant for another 50 years and open development of three new gas fields linked via a 900-kilometre pipeline. The Coalition will also pledge to legislate a ""statute of limitations"" on any activist groups that seek ""reconsideration"" of earlier federal government approvals under Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation laws. Kim Beazley is one of several former Labor leaders and other public figures to sign an open letter claiming rock art on the Burrup peninsula is under threat. That would include ""limiting the standing of third parties to challenge approval decisions"", effectively ending public calls for reconsideration after 12 months. The Coalition argues that current laws enable ""anyone"" to appeal an environmental decision, ""even people with no direct stake in the project"". There is no time limit on such appeals. It is understood the Coalition changes are aimed at limiting the impact of groups such as the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) and the Australia Institute, and says it is not against ""green"" groups. ""Activists are emboldened under this government,"" Shadow Environment Minister Jonathon Duniam said. ""They have plunged millions of dollars into the Environmental Defenders Office who have frustrated and delayed significant projects and industries across the country, and it needs to stop."" The Coalition has cited the EDO's failed attempt to halt the Santos Barossa pipeline, which saw a Federal Court judge accuse one of the group's employees of ""lying to a Tiwi Islander witness to stop a gas project"", according to Mr Duniam. Environmental protesters have long protested Woodside's proposed expansion, approved late last year by the Cook state government. (ABC News: Macey Turner) Another example, he said, was the ""revisitation by activist groups of a 12-year-old EPBC decision on salmon farming in Tasmania"". That resulted in a ""community needlessly facing uncertainty because of these broken laws"", he said. A Coalition government would also seek to strengthen use of an existing ""national interest test"" that forces government officials to consider the ""economic and social benefits"" of projects when making environmental approvals. ""National interest considerations should be a critical part of the decision-making process, but this aspect has been lost on the Labor Government who have neglected communities that have been affected by their scandalous decisions for far too long,"" Mr Duniam said. The new Woodside development is expected to generate 4.3 billion tonnes of carbon emissions over its lifetime, equivalent to Australia's total emissions budget until 2030 under Labor's climate targets. The state Labor government has been a staunch supporter of the project, with Premier Roger Cook slamming last month's federal delay. In turn, Ms Plibersek blamed the deferral on her department having insufficient time to consider the project. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek has blamed her delayed decision on the department having insufficient time to assess the project. (AAP: Lukas Coch) Development of the North West Shelf began in 1984, with the first shipments of liquefied natural gas sent in 1989, most destined for Japan. Woodside has said the project has since produced enough energy to power ""every home in a city the size of Perth for approximately 175 years"". Environmental groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, have said the project threatens the future of Scott Reef near Broome and will damage Indigenous rock art. Shadow Resources Minister Susan McDonald said the Coalition's proposals will strengthen ""northern Australia's investment credentials"". ""Once a decision is made, it should only be able to be revisited under a state or territory government request, not by a person or an activist organisation without a direct stake in the relevant project,"" she said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/dutton-vows-approval-for-woodside-north-west-shelf-gas/105068672
Former attorney-general rubbishes Dutton's 'very bad' referendum idea,Former attorney-general rubbishes Peter Dutton's 'very bad' referendum idea,2025-03-18 17:24:01,"Former attorney-general George Brandis has rubbished Peter Dutton's proposal to hold a referendum in order to deport criminal dual nationals, labelling it ""as mad an idea as I have heard in a long time"". The opposition leader confirmed he would consider holding a national poll to change the constitution if elected at the coming federal election, after the High Court ruled that only judges, not politicians, could strip people of Australian citizenship. Mr Dutton has previously criticised the government for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the failed Voice referendum during a cost of living crisis, but defended his plan on the basis that the changes required constitutional change. ""I believe we should do everything within the law to make sure that we keep Australians safe,"" he told journalists in Perth on Tuesday afternoon, doubling down on comments earlier that morning. ""If the prime minister of our country is not capable of having a debate and a conversation about the options available to us to keep our country safe, then I don't think he's worthy of his office."" Former attorney-general George Brandis has rubbished Peter Dutton's proposal to try and change the constitution to allow criminal dual citizens to be deported.  (AAP: Lukas Coch) The issue goes back to 2015 when the Abbott government introduced legislation to allow ministers to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they engaged in certain conduct, including terrorism offences. A 2022 High Court decision found the legislation was unconstitutional because it was punitive in nature, which is the purview of the courts. Currently, a politician must apply to a court to strip a dual national of their citizenship and it can only happen in limited circumstances. Mr Brandis was on the Coalition's frontbench during the original debate, during which time he opposed the move, and recommended three of the High Court judges behind the 2022 decision. ""A referendum to overturn the High Court's decision has no chance of success,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Nine newspapers. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Treasurer Jim Chalmers were equally dismissive of the surprise proposition, labelling it a ""thought bubble"" and ""bizarre"", respectively. ""This has not been thought through. It is not clear where this has come from. Peter Dutton wants to talk about anything but cost of living,"" the prime minister said. While the treasurer acknowledged that it was an ""important issue"", he accused the opposition leader of attempting to distract from his economic policies and ""coming clean on his cuts"". ""Last time he tried to impose these laws the High Court threw them out, and now he wants a referendum to fix his mistakes,"" Mr Chalmers told ABC News. ""We rewrote his broken laws to create a more robust system to keep our community safe. We've worked through it in a methodical, in a considered way. He, quite bizarrely, wants another referendum."" Meanwhile, Coalition MPs sought to downplay the prospect of a referendum if they are elected, describing it as just one option on the table and a ""last resort"". Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said it didn't amount to an election commitment in response to questions about whether it had been costed, telling journalists in Tasmania that the Coalition ""haven't announced that policy"". ""What I will say is we'll do what it takes to keep Australians safe, and we're working on citizenship eligibility policies, and we'll have more to say about it in the coming weeks."" Later that afternoon, Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien added that ""any referendum is not part of our existing plan"" and that it should be considered a last resort, echoing a similar statement from Shadow Attorney-General Michaelia Cash. ""But let's be very clear, we will do whatever it takes. And that's the message from Peter Dutton,"" he said. Nationals MP Kevin Hogan could not say how many dual nationals had committed crimes like terrorism, telling ABC News that there's ""certainly more than one"". ""We know there's been some already because we already tried to deport them. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head,"" he said. ""We don't want them to stay and I don't think that's unreasonable."" But Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie was more supportive of the proposal on Tuesday morning, telling ABC RN Breakfast that it was ""absolutely appropriate to amend our Constitution so we can keen Australians safe"". ""And I think our country is mature enough to have that debate,"" she said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/peter-dutton-referendum-bad-idea-george-brandis/105067550
"If we elect a hung parliament, voters are sending a message that can't be ignored",Labor and the Coalition are demonising a hung parliament but they’ll only have themselves to blame if it happens,2025-03-18 15:03:41,"The major parties are doing their utmost to demonise and sully the prospect of a hung parliament. Why? It's a case of (sooky) self-interest. Both major parties would like to govern in their own right without any opposition, pesky independents or small parties to negotiate with to ensure passage of government bills through the lower house. They'd prefer a rubber stamp with a majority of their own MPs blindly voting in favour of bills, to avoid amendments or serious scrutiny. I say blindly because when governments win majorities, dissent within the party is frowned upon. These MPs are often labelled troublemakers, renegades or rebels and discarded to the backbenches. What role could the independents play in deciding the next government? (Laura Tingle) In democracies we're supposed to revere free speech and freedom of expression. Discussion and debate are a form of 'pressure testing' to ensure the final product is structurally sound. What the major parties are saying about hung parliaments, subliminally, is this: 'voters, you're wrong if you vote for anyone but us'. The (old) school says: whatever the public votes for, they get right. We are a representative democracy, with preferential voting that has so far stood our democracy in good stead. The current crossbench is making no promises to guarantee support to either Labor or Coalition in a hung parliament — with nearly all saying they would force a minority government to deal with them bill by bill, and retain their right to withdraw support.  If there is a hung parliament after the coming election it's a message being sent to the major parties. Voters are saying 'you're wrong for us'. Let me spell it out in case party apparatchiks still don't get it: if there is a hung parliament, neither major party has convinced voters they have their interests at heart or are listening and governing with policies that are relevant to their communities' concerns or their own lives. As my colleague Jake Evans has noted, the last hung federal parliament (or minority parliament) in 2010 passed more than 560 bills. More than the preceding Rudd government and Howard government of 2005-2007 — when the Liberal party had a majority in both houses of parliament. Whether those bills were good or not, depends on your politics. But it means the government has to persuade crossbenchers to pass those bills. If independents and minor parties were a nuisance, voters would not return them to parliament. Crossbench fury at changes to political donation laws (Jane Norman) Lower house MPs Helen Haines, Andrew Wilkie, Rebekkah Sharkie, Bob Katter, Adam Bandt and Zali Steggall have been voted in, and returned after a term on the green benches. Some of them many times (a big HT to Katter.) Their electorates appear to value these MPs for doing what they say and saying what they do as they repeatedly return them to parliament. And voters are endorsing that by returning them to parliament while well aware these MPs and senators are not part of a major party, and aware they may not influence government decisions. But they can influence parliamentary decisions and debates that ensure the executive (the cabinet) must listen to their views, and if they want bills passed in a hung parliament, they must convince them to vote 'aye'. The maverick MP has carved out half a century in state and federal politics, with many memorable moments along the way. If major party MPs are threatened by that, maybe they should take a leaf from the independents' playbook. Ditch the mindless political messaging when you're talking with voters and they might reward that, by voting for you. We are living in the age of disruption. The ground is changing quickly in so many ways — geo-politically, technically and digitally. Domestic politics is not immune to these changes and the traditional parties shouldn't assume in times of uncertainty voters will turn to them for comfort, and regard them as political teddy bears. Voters are fed up with the hyper-partisan style of modern politics, criticism for a front-page story or TV grab. They want common sense, straight talking about the issues we're confronting now, but also a bit of vision, for example, policies that look over the horizon to ensure a sustainable, safe and solid economic future for their kids and grandkids.

Coalition's tax 'speed limit' branded 'shallow' and would not require tax cuts,Coalition's tax 'speed limit' branded 'shallow' and would not require costed tax cuts at federal election,2025-03-18 04:55:16,"The Coalition's promised ""speed limit"" on taxes has been set high enough that it can be met without offering any new tax cuts at the federal election, as a prominent economist accuses the opposition of a ""shallow"" economic policy offering. Angus Taylor on Monday restated his party's commitment to limit the amount of federal taxation to 23.9 per cent of the size of Australia's economy. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers confirms the brief era of budget surpluses will end next week, when he will hand down a budget in deficit. ""[We] must restore a tax-to-GDP cap and fiscal guardrails to reduce wasteful spending,"" the shadow treasurer said. That figure, a longstanding Coalition budget rule, is based on the average rate that has prevailed since the Howard government. It has never been exceeded since that time and budget papers project it will not be breached over the next four years. That means the Coalition can commit to a 23.9 per cent limit without needing to provide any costed policy for tax cuts in the election campaign, something Mr Taylor previously suggested he would do but which Peter Dutton had since poured cold water on. ""It depends really on where the figures are, and we'll get more detail in the budget,"" the opposition leader told reporters on Monday. ""What we don't want to do is fuel inflation … So if we can afford to do tax cuts, we will, but it will depend on how much money is in the budget."" Labor did away with the 23.9 per cent limit, which Treasurer Jim Chalmers calls ""arbitrary"", but has nonetheless stayed beneath it. Federal tax hit 23.8 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 but fell with the introduction of the stage 3 tax cuts, and it will rise no further than 23.5 per cent over the next four years, according to the latest budget forecast. Treasurer Jim Chalmers will deliver the last budget of this parliamentary term next week. (ABC News: Mark Moore) The budget's less precise medium-term projections suggest the figure will creep up to 24.5 per cent by 2034-35, but by convention this assumes no further tax cuts over that period, which history suggests is extremely unlikely. The Coalition's commitment to 23.9 per cent amounts in practice to a promise for tax cuts at some point over the decade, but without details about what form they would take. Mr Taylor said Labor had ""broken every promise on tax it made before the last election, and hard-working Australians are paying the price… Labor abolished the tax cap in its first budget, the Coalition will restore it"". Mr Chalmers said Mr Taylor had ""a lot of nerve talking about the tax cuts when [he] tried to prevent 3 million people getting the tax cut that Labor is delivering"", a reference to the Coalition's short-lived objection to Labor's redesigned stage 3 tax cut. Economist Saul Eslake said a 23.9 per cent limit was ""entirely arbitrary"" and would not address the imbalance between tax revenue and the pressure on the government to spend. ""It has been clear since the last Morrison government budget that spending as a proportion of GDP is going to be 1.5—2 percentage points higher than the average from 1975 to 2019,"" he told the ABC. The opposition leader said the inflation environment and government spending undermined the affordability of restoring the Coalition's full tax cut for high earners. Federal spending is set to hit 27.2 per cent of GDP next financial year, the highest level seen for 40 years apart from during the pandemic. ""It's very clear that the public wants more spending on health, aged care, disability care and probably child care as well, and any party that says it's not going to meet those expectations is not going to be in government,"" Mr Eslake said. ""There is also a bipartisan consensus that, whether the public want it or not, they're going to get more spending on defence. ""Unless we want to leave the cost of all that spending on future generations, we need to have what some people call an adult conversation with the electorate about how to raise additional revenue in the least economically damaging or fairest ways."" Mr Eslake said both parties were avoiding this question. ""The fact that the best [the Coalition] can come up with is an arbitrarily chosen number from a period that is receding into ancient history, it just shows you how shallow they are and how little thought they are really putting into remedying Australia's fiscal challenges."" Economist Saul Eslake says the Coalition is not thinking deeply enough about the budget's structural challenges. (ABC News: Owain Stia-James) He said he was not critical of Labor for shirking tax reform in its first term, having dropped it from the party's platform after a range of tax policies were rejected in the 2019 election, but he said it should show more ambition this time. ""I don't have any sense the government is planning to go to the people asking for a mandate to reform the tax system,"" he said. ANU economist Kristen Sobeck said the appropriate level of taxation was ""for the public to decide"", but that it was more urgent to change the mix of Australia's tax collection, rather than the amount. ""The composition of how we pay for things is just not sustainable,"" she told the ABC. ""No matter what level we set it on, if we continue on with this excessive reliance on personal income tax and also corporate tax, it just doesn't work. ""At the moment, it's really 30, 40 and 50-year-olds who are paying the majority of income tax, and they're going to get smaller as a percentage of the population."" Dr Sobeck said taxing land more heavily instead of incomes would be more equitable, more efficient and good for Australia's productivity, but it was not part of the political discussion because it was ""political suicide"". Kristen Sobeck says tax reform to reduce our reliance on income tax could have benefits for equity, efficiency and productivity. (ABC News: John Gunn) ""Tax reform would be a win on efficiency, a win on equity, a win on productivity, so there's a lot of wins. Usually we think of those things as a trade-off, but Australia's case is a bit of a unicorn. It's just that would be incredibly unpopular."" Labor appears likely to avoid substantial new tax policies in next week's federal budget, which Labor source said would have ""fewer surprises"". Instead, the treasurer will use a speech to the Queensland Media Club on Tuesday to highlight Labor's existing spending promises, including its $8.5 billion expansion of the bulk-billing incentive, $7.2 billion for the Bruce Highway, and several billion dollars to prop up the Whyalla Steelworks. Mr Chalmers will frame the budget in the context of global uncertainty, saying the Trump administration's trade policy has brought ""seismic"" and ""self-sabotaging"" changes with a ""manageable"" but noticeable effect on the Australian economy. ""Even in the most benign scenario, global growth over the next three years is expected to be its weakest since the 1990s,"" he is expected to say.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-18/coalition-tax-speed-limit-would-not-require-tax-cuts/105063526
Jim Chalmers confirms deficit in next week's federal budget,Jim Chalmers confirms deficit in next week's federal budget,2025-03-18 11:20:28,"Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has confirmed the brief era of budget surpluses will end next week, when he will hand down a budget in deficit. A decade of budgets in the red has been forecast by the federal government for some time, but a weak Australian dollar had increased revenues from minerals exports and fuelled speculation the treasurer might be able to eke out one last surplus. Mr Chalmers confirmed on Monday morning that, as predicted, next week he would hand down a budget with a deficit forecast for this year. ""A defining feature of our first three budgets was responsible economic management. That will be a defining feature of the fourth as well,"" Mr Chalmers said. ""Even this year, where we will be printing a deficit for this year, it will be much, much smaller than what we inherited from our political opponents, and that shows the progress we have been able to make."" The government delivered two surpluses back-to-back, for the first time in a decade — thanks in particular to low unemployment delivering more income tax revenue, and higher-than-expected coal and mineral export prices. But with structural issues in the budget remaining and an ongoing cost-of-living crisis, the Coalition has been pointing to how much taxpayers are forking over, releasing figures overnight that targeted average tax paid in the nation's most marginal electorates. Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor will tour a number of those electorates this week, raising income tax as an issue — though the Coalition is yet to state any policy of its own to reduce income tax. The Coalition's analysis, released by the shadow treasurer, suggested the average amount of tax Australians would pay this year would be $3,500 higher than in 2021-22, as rising wages pushed more earnings into higher tax brackets. ""These are the pains that Australians are feeling. We need a budget that restores Australians' standard of living,"" Mr Taylor said. ""It is clear taxes are on the rise if Labor's policy settings continue. Labor abolished the tax cap in its first budget, the Coalition will restore it."" Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the average Australian is paying thousands more in taxes than they were three years ago. (ABC News: Marcus Stimson) The treasurer dismissed the Coalition's promise, raised again by Mr Taylor, to reintroduce its self-imposed cap on revenue raising. The Coalition says it will reinstate its tax-to-GDP ratio cap of 23.9 per cent if it wins the next election. While Mr Chalmers dumped that cap when Labor took power in 2022, calling it arbitrary, the government has also kept taxation under that level. The treasurer said on Monday the only government that had ever exceeded that ratio was John Howard's. Australia's tax-to-GDP ratio, including state and local taxes, remains below the OECD average.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-17/chalmers-deficit-federal-budget-confirmation/105060688
Donald Trump's new world order has a lesson for Peter Dutton,Talking points kept the Coalition's tariff message clear but failed to read the room on Trump,2025-03-17 11:41:47,"Talking points exist to keep political parties on message and to discipline the team to be literally singing from the same political song sheet. It's annoying for journalists and the general public to hear those same things on repeat but the purpose of talking points is to help ensure there's no policy freestyling that can signal division, and lack of readiness for government. This week, the Coalition's song sheet on Donald Trump's blanket steel and aluminium tariffs with no exceptions for Australia was so squarely focused on holding the Albanese government entirely responsible that a few Coalition MPs have told me they found them difficult to repeat. When a malignant force bears down on the country, Australians have shown a tendency to swing behind the leader. The talking points — shared with this column to highlight the point, referred to ""Labor's Failure"" — acknowledging this was a bad decision by the Trump administration. The talking points then continue under headings smashing the Australian government, including that the PM can't even get a call; that the the PM is out of his depth; that it shows a failure by government; and that it shows the PM to be weak. Subtle? Not so much. Not all Liberals think the opposition has struck the right tone in reacting to Trump's decision to reject Australian requests for an exemption. Some have told me the opposition needs to be clearer in denouncing the Trump administration for the behaviour rather than scoring domestic political points and making it all about Albanese. That's not to say they are opposed to the PM receiving criticism — but they believe it has been over the top and has not been clear enough that they think Trump and his administration's isolationism is the problem here. The risk for the Coalition is that in its clamour this close to the election to use the decision by Trump to highlight what they have long been arguing to be Albanese's weakness, they haven't read the room on just how troubled Australian voters are with Trump himself. A new poll obtained by this column demonstrates the extent of the disapproval of Trump. Talbot Mills Research asked 1,051 Australian voters between March 6 and 12: ""How strongly do you approve or disapprove of the job President Trump is doing as US President?"" Trump, who was already unpopular in Australia, has become even more unpopular since the last time people were asked in their survey a month before. David Talbot from Talbot Mills Research said the disapproval of Trump in Australia was strengthening. ""A majority of Australians disapprove of the United States' decision to impose tariffs on Australian steel and aluminium,"" he says. ""Australians' impressions of Trump's performance are also on the slide, with a six-point jump in those strongly disapproving of the job he's doing."" A massive 65 per cent of Australians disapprove of the United States imposing tariffs on Australian steel and aluminium on Australia. Why does it matter? Australians are rusted on to the view that Trump is a problem and a narrative that the Australian government can somehow win under his reign is becoming less plausible. Australia now goes into an election campaign in which the spectre of Trump, his economically reckless policies at home, and his erratic attempts at foreign policy machismo loom large. Voters who identify as Coalition voters are much more sympathetic to the job Trump is doing — and herein exists the issue for Peter Dutton. Of those identifying as Liberal/National voters, 48 per cent approve of the job Trump is doing. It puts the dilemma for Peter Dutton in perspective: almost half his supporters think Trump is a net positive. The rest of the nation, including voters who he needs to capture, are less convinced. Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you. Dutton must distance himself from Trump and the Trump agenda if he intends to speak to a wider section of the electorate. Yet he remains under pressure from his own rusted-on voters who are sympathetic to Trump. It is this inherent tension he is trying to manage and it is playing out inside his party room too. Some MPs want tougher talk about Trump. Others would like to see more of the Trump-style policies adopted in Australia. Across the world, like-minded countries with leaders muscling up to Trump are seeing the domestic political dividend. In Canada, former central banker Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister, is seeing a turnaround in his electoral chances at the upcoming election largely on the back of tough talk on Trump. Of course, Australia is not being threatened with becoming the 51st state, but it is a lesson as to the expectations of voters in the new world order. Want even more?

Greens leader urges end to the AUKUS deal with 'very dangerous' Trump,Greens leader Adam Bandt says Australia should walk away from AUKUS in wake of Trump's tariffs,2025-03-16 15:06:50,"Greens leader Adam Bandt says the government should get out of the AUKUS deal with the United States and explore other relationships in the wake of Donald Trump's tariffs, warning it puts a ""very big"" target on Australia's back. The minor party has long opposed the AUKUS nuclear submarine project, which is expected to cost $368 billion, but Mr Bandt said the new tariffs imposed this week were a ""wake-up call that we need to rethink our relationship with the United States"". ""We should get out of AUKUS, now is not the time to be hitching Australia's wagon to Donald Trump — it puts Australia at risk and it is billions of dollars being spent on submarines that might never arrive,"" he told ABC's Insiders on Sunday. Mr Bandt said the US president was a ""very dangerous man"" and it was ""wishful thinking"" to believe he would come to Australia's aid in the event of a security threat. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already ruled out walking away from the AUKUS deal as a response to the tariffs, describing it as a ""good deal for Australia"". The final details of Australia's first nuclear submarine fleet have been unveiled — along with the price tag.  The trilateral agreement with the US and UK would deliver Australia eight new nuclear submarines based on British design and with American technology, with the first five due by the middle of the 2050s. The federal government had fought for an exemption to Mr Trump's sweeping 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports, but on Wednesday the White House revealed that no country would be spared. In the wake of the decision, Mr Albanese said it was ""not a friendly act"" and lashed the US president's order as ""entirely unjustified"". But he said Australia would not respond with tariffs of its own, pivoting instead to a pre-election pitch at Australians to ""buy local"". The opposition has blamed the government for the failure to secure an exemption, as was the case under the Coalition during the first Trump administration, with Peter Dutton claiming he would be able to make a deal with the US president if elected at the upcoming election. Trade Minister Don Farrell on Sunday said the key task for the government now was to ""find out what it is that the Americans want in terms of this relationship … and then make President Trump an offer he can't refuse"". Don Farrell spoke to his US counterpart Howard Lutnik on Friday about the new steel and aluminium tariffs.  (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Senator Farrell, who spoke with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, once again said that Australia would not pursue retaliatory tariffs on the US like some other nations. ""It hasn't worked for any other country, why would it work for us?"" he said in an interview with Sky News. ""He [Mr Lutnik] gave no assurances about what might happen in the next round of negotiations, our job is to sit down and continue to talk."" Like Labor and the Coalition, Mr Bandt said the Greens don't support imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US because it was clear they would not lead to Mr Trump reconsidering an exemption. Instead he said there was ""strength in numbers"" with other countries impacted by the US president's orders and ""economically we should be exploring diversifying our relationship with those countries"". ""But in terms of a lasting arrangement now for the future, it has to be more based on what's in Australia's interest."" The Greens are preparing for the possibility of a minority government after the federal election, which is due on or before May 17. Mr Bandt said the party would be ""open minded"" to striking a formal agreement with Labor if that eventuated, as was the case in 2010, categorically ruling out working with the Coalition leader. He said his preference would be to work with Labor to get action on the cost of living crisis and climate change. The Greens leader has put the prime minister on notice that his party would seek ""in advance"" to lock in a ""stable and progressive"" deal with Labor to form a potential minority government. ""What people are wanting is more voices at the table to push Labor to act on some of these things that they've been ignoring,"" he said. ""And the flip side is that when you have greater representation in parliament, we've all got to work together and cooperate to get outcomes for people and that would be the spirit we'd go into it with."" The Greens wrote to the government on Friday with an offer to support Labor measures in return for an immediate slashing of student debt and a tripling of the bulk billing incentive. Labor has vowed to knock 20 per cent off student loans as one of its main pitches to younger voters, but not until after the election. Instead the Greens want to see the measure passed by parliament when it returns for three days later this month so the government can hand down a federal budget, the last opportunity for laws to be passed before Australians go to the polls. For a university graduate with the average debt of $27,600, that would mean about $5,520 wiped from their loan balance. Meanwhile, he said a hung parliament would be a ""once in a generation chance"" to push the major parties to act. ""There's a reason that the experts are saying we are heading towards a minority parliament. People want real action on the climate, want real action on housing, on health care,"" he said. ""And last time there was minority parliament, the Greens got dental into Medicare for kids. This time we could get in for everyone.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-16/greens-adam-bandt-aukus-insiders/105057580

"Do offshore turbines kill whales? Wind farm facts, fiction and unknowns","Do offshore wind farms kill whales? The facts, fiction and unknowns of marine renewable energy",2025-03-17 11:29:20,"A new battleground is emerging in Australia's oceans over renewable energy projects the government says are necessary to dealing with climate change and reducing our country's carbon emissions. Just one spin of an offshore wind turbine can power the average Australian home for 48 hours, according to wind energy companies. The Albanese government has set aside six offshore wind farm zones around Australia — two off Victoria's coast, two off NSW and one each for Tasmania and Western Australia. If elected in the upcoming federal poll, the Dutton-led Coalition has promised to scrap three of these — Victoria's Southern Ocean wind zone and two in NSW, off Port Stephens and the Illawarra. Just like their onshore counterparts, the push to build offshore wind farms has met resistance. Offshore wind energy has been used in countries like the United Kingdom since the 1990s.  (Reuters: Phil Noble) Opposition has come from all over the political landscape, from environmentalists concerned about the impact on marine life, fishermen suspicious of affects on their livelihoods, locals worried about the visual impact, and conservatives fundamentally opposed to green energy. But do the various claims of those opponents hold water? While there's a lot we don't know about offshore wind farms, there's a lot we do — they have been in place around the world for more than 30 years. We've spoken to the experts to try to separate fact from fiction when it comes to offshore wind farms. Whales appear to be the main species that the public and coastal communities are concerned will be impacted by offshore wind farms, with protesters even using cartoonish imagery of dead whales impaled on turbines to make their point. The southern right whale is classified as endangered in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania and some of the proposed wind farm zones border whale nurseries, including in south-west Victoria. No scientific study has linked offshore wind farm to whale deaths.  (ABC News: Lucy Seddon-Brown) Environmental consultant Nelli Stevenson, a former head of investigations at Greenpeace Australia, said there had been plenty of studies into the effects of offshore wind farms on whales and marine mammals, and not a single peer-reviewed study had found offshore wind farms kill whales. While there are no adverse effects once a wind farms is established, there is a possibility construction phase could cause some disturbance to marine life, including whales. The federal government's National Recovery Plan for the Southern Right Whale notes that ""offshore development … could lead to disturbance of southern right whale, and may act as barriers to migration to coastal breeding areas"". Underwater noise during the construction phase, including pile driving and vessel noise, could be problematic. The recovery plan states the potential for impacts from underwater noise is a concern within or close to habitats critical to survival, such as a whale nursery, as underwater noise could deter whales from using these areas. Underwater noise from support vessels on offshore wind farms could impact whales. (Supplied: Southerly Ten) Most of the research into underwater noise focuses on the construction of offshore wind farms rather than their operation. The plan noted it was unclear how electric and magnetic fields from subsea power cables impacted whales. Norway's Institute of Marine Research says more research is needed into the effect of cabling, but what has been done to date shows minimal effects. Experts around the world agree more research is needed to fully understand the impacts of offshore wind on whales, but they also agree it is a myth that wind turbines kill whales. A 2023 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the United States fishing industry said offshore wind farm construction and operation would have varying impacts on the marine environment but further research was needed. While there's evidence wind turbines can benefit fishing stocks by creating artificial habitats that attract fish, overseas studies have also shown UK commercial fishers have been displaced by wind farms and had to travel further to new fishing grounds. Offshore wind could have an impact on fishers in Australia. (Supplied: WA Fishing Council) Some types of fishing, such as bottom trawling, risk snagging on underwater cables so this might not be compatible with offshore turbines. There is also often an exclusion or ""buffer"" zone to keep recreational fishers away, although energy company Star of the South, which is behind a project slated for the south coast of Gippsland, says commercial fishing will be allowed as long as it's ""safe and practical"". According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, turbines do kill birds ""but only a fraction as many as are killed by house cats, buildings, or even the fossil fuel operations that wind farms replace"". MIT said the numbers of birds killed was ""not insignificant"", but ""scientists and conservationists are actively working to minimise bird interactions at wind facilities"". Short-tailed shearwaters are among the migratory bird species opponents of offshore wind are concerned about being killed by turbines. (Supplied: QUT) The Australian government's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water (DCCEEW) 2022 report into the impacts of offshore wind farms outlined ways to reduce these risks, including fewer and larger turbines and to temporarily shut down turbines or cease construction during known migration times. The UK government has begun a trial to paint wind turbine blades black to reduce collisions, following a study in Norway that showed painting one blade of a turbine black resulted in a 70 per cent decline in related bird deaths. The experts are unequivocal — climate change and its knock-on effects, such as warming ocean temperatures and ocean acidification, present the biggest threat to marine life. Marine ecologist Dr Matt Edmunds said that without increased renewable energy, marine life as we know it could be destroyed. Dr Edmunds said offshore wind farms were not without risks, but were preferable to sticking with the status quo. The Great Barrier Reef experienced another mass bleaching event in early 2024, following a record marine heatwave in Western Australia.  (Supplied: Ove Hoegh-Guldberg) ""If we just continue to burn fossil fuels and not move to renewable energy, then those whales will be far more impacted because their food sources, such as krill, won't be there and the whales will be far worse off,"" Dr Edmunds said. ""Right now, the absolute greatest threat to our oceans is climate change caused by the mining and burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas,"" Ms Stevenson said. Seismic testing is not needed to build wind farms. The DCCEEW said information about the seabed of proposed wind zones was gathered using methods that have much lower sound levels than those in the oil and gas industry. Sonar mapping is among these options. Renewable energy company Alinta Energy, which has a feasibility license for a farm in the Southern Ocean windzone, has ruled out the use of seismic testing. Seismic testing, using air guns pulled by a seismic survey vessel, is not necessary for construction offshore wind.  (Supplied: Australian Institute of Marine Science) Environmental consultant Nelli Stevenson said there was ""a world of difference"" between seismic testing for oil and gas, and methods like sonar mapping of the seabed. ""Oil and gas surveys are much, much louder because they need to penetrate several kilometres into the earth to find oil and gas,"" Ms Stevenson said. How well you can see turbines from the shore depends on factors including how far away they are, how big they are and the weather, notes the DCCEEW. The noise from offshore wind farms was unlikely to affect people onshore, as the turbines would be 10 kilometres distant, the department said. The federal government released a visualisation of what BlueFloat Energy's farm would look like from Bulli Lookout in New South Wales. (Supplied: Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water) The department said offshore wind was unlikely to impact tourism, pointing to a US study that found a third of people would avoid the beach if turbines were four kilometres off the coast, but that figure dropped to just 5 per cent if the turbines were about 30 kilometres off the coast. This study also found an increase in ""curiosity trips"" by people visiting a location to see the wind farms. All the experts the ABC spoke to said there needed to be more research into the impact of offshore turbines on marine life, particularly whales. But at the same time, Dr Edmunds said this lack of information should not prevent action that abates the impacts of climate change. ""There'll always be unknowns,"" Dr Edmunds said. ""We can never find out everything we need to know until you actually start doing it."" He said installing wind turbines would allow for adaptive management of potential impacts of a zone. Environmental consultant Nelli Stevenson agreed local research was needed. ""These peer-reviewed studies have all been undertaken overseas, as Australia doesn't have any offshore wind farms yet, so we encourage new research to be undertaken here in Australia as our offshore wind industry is developed,"" Ms Stevenson said. Victorian National Parks Association's Shannon Hurley said there were ""huge knowledge gaps"" as most studies on the effects of offshore wind farms were done in the northern hemisphere. ""The same science cannot necessarily be applied to the southern hemisphere,"" she said. ""We need dedicated research down here and because there aren't yet wind farms in place, it's hard to know what the impacts will be."" Thank you for your submissions to Your Say.

Internal polling shows female voters 'coming back' to Coalition,Liberal MPs quietly hopeful female voters returning to party post Scott Morrison,2025-03-14 11:14:46,"Female voters are ""coming back"" to the Coalition, according to internal Liberal Party polling, with some MPs quietly hopeful leader Peter Dutton is more accepted by women than his predecessor Scott Morrison. As the major parties shift into election campaign mode, some Liberal MPs have told the ABC they believe the gender issues that drove away female voters in 2022, such as allegations of sexual assault in Parliament House, are no longer a major talking point amongst the public. But the Coalition is working off a low base, after women gave the party its lowest level of support ever in 2022, at just 32 per cent. Female Liberal MPs the ABC has spoken to said while they regularly received criticism about Mr Morrison during the 2022 campaign, they do not receive as many queries about Mr Dutton. Liberal MP for the Sydney seat of Hughes, Jenny Ware, said she believed Mr Dutton was more palatable to women than the former prime minister. ""That has been my experience campaigning now, as opposed to campaigning three years ago,"" she said. ""A lot of the professional women did desert us at the last election, they are definitely coming back."" The Liberal Party points to internal polling, done by Freshwater Strategy, which shows a jump in the female primary vote for the Coalition, from 34 per cent in December 2022, which was after the election, to 42 per cent in 2025. An age breakdown of the results, seen by the ABC, shows increases in the female vote in every age category, with the largest jump in support from women aged 18-34. On a two-party preferred basis, the Freshwater polling suggests 52 per cent of women would prefer the Coalition in 2025. But Labor still remains the favoured major party with female voters in other polls, published by Essential and Resolve in recent months. A senior Labor source told the ABC its own internal research does not indicate Mr Dutton will win over women. ""Peter Dutton is as unpopular with Australian woman as Scott Morrison was,"" the source said. One of the party's most prominent women, Shadow Finance Minister Senator Jane Hume, told the ABC Mr Dutton had shown ""great leadership"" on women's issues, ""particularly in his strong advocacy for women's safety, and domestic and sexual violence"". Liberal Senator Jane Hume said Peter Dutton had shown ""great leadership"" on women's issues. (ABC News: ian cutmore) The Liberal Party website said its policy for women's safety was to extend emergency payments to support women and children fleeing domestic violence. The Coalition has also been criticised by the government for proposing Commonwealth public servants no longer work from home, unless in special circumstances, a position Minister for Women Katy Gallagher said disadvantaged women and families. Labor has pitched more heavily to female voters during this term, extending paid parental leave, scrapping the activity test for families seeking childcare subsidies, and a $500 million women's health package announced in February, which Mr Dutton said he would support. The Morrison government dealt with scandals around the treatment of women within Parliament House, including former staffer Brittney Higgins' sexual assault allegation, which sparked a series of protests around the country. Following the 2022 defeat, Senator Hume co-wrote a review of the result, which found the Liberal Party was ""failing to adequately represent the values and priorities of women in modern Australia,"" and a lack of confidence that women within the party would be encouraged into leadership roles. Nationals leader, then deputy leader, David Littleproud said last year that by 2021, ""women had lost faith"" in the Coalition. Ms Ware said the professional women in her electorate who abandoned the party last election were not as focused on the issue this time around. Liberal MP Jenny Ware said she believed professional women in her electorate were returning to the party after ditching it in 2022. (ABC News) ""There is one issue in this election, and that's cost of living,"" she said. ""[Peter Dutton] has not had to deal with those sorts of issues."" But one Liberal MP, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the ABC she was unconvinced the party had changed since 2022, and said proof of that would be more women being pre-selected into winnable seats. ""It's not clear what's changed,"" she said. ""Show me the evidence. ""How are we demonstrating how we're more supportive of women?"" Liberal sources have pointed to the seat of Monash, where Liberal candidate Mary Aldred will run against Liberal turned-independent Russell Broadbent, as a woman being placed into a winnable seat. But six men have been chosen to run for other seats being left vacant by retiring Liberal MPs. Senator Hume's review recommended a 50 per cent target of female representation in both parliamentary ranks and the Liberal executive by 2032 — a target the party is likely to pursue without using quotas. Senator Hume has previously described quotas as a ""top-down measure"" which the ""grassroots"" membership base would not support.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/female-voters-coming-back-to-coalition-internal-polling/105051676
Victoria tips from 'giver' to 'taker' in GST carve-up with $3.7b boon,Victoria tips from 'giver' to 'taker' in GST carve-up with $3.7 billion boon,2025-03-14 11:41:04,"An update to the GST carve-up has shifted Victoria from being a ""lifter"" to a ""leaner"", with substantial population growth and a struggling economy meaning it will take a relatively larger share of the GST at the expense of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. Victoria's take of the Goods and Services Tax will increase by $3.7 billion from last year, lifting its share from 24.8 per cent to 27.5 per cent of the total GST pool. ""Victoria's GST distribution is estimated to increase significantly from last year,"" the Commonwealth Grants Commission confirmed. ""This is largely driven by its lower capacity to raise mining revenue relative to the main mining states and its higher relative state population growth. ""Victoria's assessed GST needs also increased substantially because of the change in the method for assessing COVID-19 health and business support expenses."" However, while the GST authority said Victoria's share would grow, it said all states should expect to benefit from an estimated increase in the GST pool from $91 billion this financial year to $95 billion in 2025-26. The commission also confirmed that WA would receive an estimate $6 billion more this year than it would have without a deal struck by former prime minister Scott Morrison in 2018 that guarantees it no less than 75 cents in each dollar raised for its population. Only Queensland will receive less GST in 2025-26 than it did the year before. The distribution of revenue from the Goods and Services Tax is recalculated each year, with a larger per capita share paid to some states than others based on their relative need and ability to raise revenue. The annual decision reliably prompts anger from state premiers and treasurers, who complain of being ""robbed"" to prop up smaller states. Since the GST's inception in 2000, those complaints have come mostly from the two largest states, NSW and Victoria, and in more recent years from Western Australia as royalties on mining exports have raised billions more for the state. But Victoria had been on a knife's edge of tipping from being an relative contributor to a relative beneficiary of the GST, which makes up about half of all payments to the states and territories. Earlier, economist Saul Eslake told the ABC because coal prices were higher in the years the Commonwealth Grants Commission will be considering, it would likely mean that Queensland and NSW's relative needs will fall. ""As a result of which, all else being equal, you'd expect Victoria's to rise a bit further,"" Mr Eslake said. Mr Eslake noted that the GST has never been distributed on an equal per capita basis, nor were any other Commonwealth payments in the decades before the GST was introduced. Last year's carve-up recalculation caused a fracas, with NSW Premier Chris Minns deriding Victoria as a ""welfare state"" and former Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas retorting that he was a ""tool"" and ""dripping"" with entitlement, after the southern state's share of GST money ticked up significantly. Each year, the Commonwealth Grants Commission determines the relative need of each state and territory by comparing each's population, its financial needs and its comparative ability to raise revenue. It then determines the share of the total pool of GST revenue each state and territory will receive (though a deal by former prime minister Scott Morrison means the payments to some states are artificially inflated). That design is intended to ensure each state and territory is able to deliver fairly equal health, schooling, justice and other services to its residents. When the GST was created in 2000, Victoria received a relative 85 cents for each $1 raised. Last year, the share Victoria received relative to its population ticked up to 97 cents for each $1. Today's carve-up sees Victoria tip to the other side of the ledger, receiving $1.07 for every $1, before adding ""no worse off"" payments agreed by Mr Morrison. Today's decision again brings a windfall to Western Australia, which will see billions more tipped into the state coffers than what the mining state would be expected to naturally receive thanks to a deal struck by former prime minister Scott Morrison in 2018. The Commonwealth Grants Commission said WA will receive an extra $6 billion more next financial year than it otherwise would have. Mr Morrison, with the backing of Labor, negotiated a deal to reform how GST would be distributed — with a guarantee during the 10-year transition that WA would never receive less than 70 cents in each dollar, and from last year 75 cents in each dollar. Like clockwork, the release of the draft GST split has set off bickering and recriminations among state treasurers. How is the money split up and why is it so controversial? Other states and territories were also promised during that time their GST payments would be no worse off under the new deal than they would have been in the old deal, with the Commonwealth covering that gap. That deal, described by Mr Eslake as ""the worst public policy decision of the 21st century so far"", has cost the Commonwealth billions and is expected to total a $50 billion hit to the federal budget over the transition decade. ""It amounts to a corruption of the purpose behind the biggest single spending program in the federal budget … a program that makes Australia a better country than other federations such as the United States,"" Mr Eslake said. ""We now have a system that ultimately guarantees that Western Australians, residents of the richest state in the country, will end up getting better public services and lower state taxes than the rest of Australians."" But with the GST advantage to the west politically sacred in that state, and a federal election nearing, neither of the major parties are likely to suggest reclaiming the massive expense to the federal budget.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/gst-carve-up-victoria-relative-need/105046450
"'We've got options' on critical minerals, Labor warns US",Minister warns US that Australia has other buyers for critical minerals,2025-03-14 12:16:40,"The Albanese government is putting the Trump administration on notice that Australia has a bevy of alternative partners across Europe and Asia to help it develop critical minerals as exporters brace for a second-wave of US tariffs in April. ""The truth is these minerals and rare earths are in high demand,"" Resources Minister Madeleine King told the ABC. ""We would very much like to have a partnership with the US, but if they don't want to do that, then that's up to them and we'll continue to work with other nations as well."" The PM suggests Australians should buy local goods instead of American ones ahead of a federal budget expected to have an ""Australian-made"" theme. For the past two years or so, senior ministers have been preparing the ground to work more closely with countries other than the US in expanding extraction and domestic processing of materials critical to the manufacture of green energy and defence systems. Those efforts are now being used to remind the White House in what Ambassador Kevin Rudd has called ""a vastly different America"" that there will be consequences if Australia is punished via another round of tariffs. The push to nudge the US about the importance of critical minerals development between the two countries, which began during the first Trump administration when the president signed a series of executive orders on the topic with the Morrison and Turnbull governments, comes as Labor rules out retaliatory tariffs. Donald Trump has developed an intense interest in the topic of rare earths and critical minerals — a market that is almost entirely dominated by China — and has linked their extraction to supposed takeovers of Canada, Greenland and deals with Ukraine. Madeleine King, pictured here with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, said Australia had many interested buyers of critical minerals, a market currently dominated by China. (ABC News: Keane Bourke) Ms King suggested those options are all problematic, whereas Australia offers a stable democratic market with a ""very long-term, deep relationship"" with the US. ""Of course we're a more attractive destination,"" she said. ""But maybe it doesn't fit that narrative that they want at the moment."" She named Japan, South Korea and the European Union as partners that know the importance of an open trading system Critical minerals are among several strands of argument the Labor government is putting forward for why Australia should be carved out of the Trump administration's coming round of ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which could hit agricultural, pharmaceutical and other exporters. It also comes as a political storm continues over Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's inability to secure a second phone conversation with the president since he took office, which the Coalition says would not have happened on their watch. Mr Rudd hit back on Thursday, telling 7.30 another call would not have ""made a material difference"". Australia's ambassador to the United States has warned negotiations with the second Trump administration will continue to be ""tough and rough"". Australia is dealing with ""an administration which has a very deep-seated view that tariffs are the way to the future"", he said. Mr Rudd said he had talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick through ""into the early days of this week"", describing them as ""tough and hard"". He said Australia was ""uniquely positioned"" to help the US with its ""strategic vulnerabilities"" when it came to critical minerals. ""If you do the maths, it's pretty interesting. America designates itself as having 50 categories of critical minerals which it needs for the future … We are currently supplying 28 and can supply 36 of them. Former foreign minister Bob Carr said in a separate interview with 7.30 that Australia needs to recognise that the Republican party is no longer a supporter of ""liberal internationalism"". ""It's now a Bonapartist party in thrall to a single powerful leader who expunges any rivals and crushes any criticism,"" Mr Carr said. Former foreign minister Bob Carr said America had become ""Bonapartist"" and no longer believed in the liberal international order. (ABC News) That reality means Australia needs to develop its ""international character"", he added. ""There's got to be a whole lot less America and more Asia… and a whole lot more international engagement. ""I don't think we should have retaliatory tariffs directed at America, but I do think it's an opportunity to begin to explore with the French the alternative to AUKUS."" Assistant Trade Minister Tim Ayres said there was a ""really rocky road ahead"" for the bilateral trade relationship and the government would ""negotiate that carefully"". ""We're not getting ahead of that by flagging what we're doing on critical minerals,"" he said in an interview on Thursday. ""It's in the national interest and we'd love to see more US investment in critical minerals and critical minerals processing [in Australia]."" Labor is banking on voters appreciating that this time around with Trump is different.   However, he added, ""we've got alternatives"", particularly ""with strong relationships with Europe and the UK. ""It's a key national advantage,"" he said. Trade Minister Don Farrell echoed the sentiment, saying the Chinese tariff row with Australia demonstrated the need to diversity trade. ""We want good trading relationships with all … so that we're never again reliant on one single country. ""Tariffs are not a way to increase your prosperity."" Mr Farrell also hit back at Mr Lutnick, who claimed this week that Australian steel shippers are flooding the US market. ""This is absolutely untrue,"" he said. ""Australian sales of steel and aluminium represent less than 2 per cent of all steel and aluminium coming into the US. ""We have not been dumping our product into the US. It's simply been a trickle. ""Mr Lutnick has simply got this wrong. Australia doesn't dump … we produce good quality steel, aluminium and sell it at commercial rates."" The minister said he would speak to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer over the weekend. Mr Albanese was in Perth on Friday to announce a new $750 million fund to trial and develop green technology in the metal manufacturing sector, including aluminium and steel. Grants would be allocated by the independent renewables agency ARENA. ""We can have a competitive advantage if we are smart… We want to make Australian steel and aluminium the best in the world,"" the PM told reporters. ""We want to see more Australian workers make more things here."" Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic said ""green metal"" demand would soon account for a third of global metal demand. He said the purpose of the fund was to ""take the know how out of our researchers and our universities and get it into our mills and our smelters… ""When we see the way trade is changing before our eyes, we've got to get an edge, and that's what this is about.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-14/australia-warns-it-has-other-buyers-for-critical-minerals/105049424
Albanese invokes 'Team Australia' in pitch to buy local after Trump tariffs,Anthony Albanese invokes 'Team Australia' in pitch to buy local after Trump tariffs,2025-03-13 04:42:55,"Anthony Albanese will urge Australians to ""buy local"" in a pre-election attempt to galvanise voter anger at Donald Trump after the US president refused to exempt Australian steel and aluminium from his tariff regime. Adamant that retaliating with ""revenge"" tariffs would simply fuel domestic inflation, the prime minister instead invoked ""Team Australia"" in a flurry of radio calls on Wednesday afternoon. ""Australians can have an impact by buying Australian goods,"" he told ABC Melbourne. ""Buy Bundy rather than some of the American products … You can make a difference."" The prime minister has dipped his toe into the raging public debate over the Trump administration as he seeks to make a ""Team Australia"" appeal. Though Mr Albanese stopped short of advocating an American boycott like those seen in Canada, his language echoed the Canadian government's parochial response to Mr Trump, which has revived its flagging political fortunes. Labor believes it can benefit from a milder version of that approach, according to senior sources who said next fortnight's budget would have an ""Australian-made"" focus. The government is weighing how to harness its own considerable purchasing power to support local businesses by ensuring more of them can win federal procurement contracts. Australia-US relations tested as businesses brace for Trump's trade war. Those contracts were worth $100 billion in the last financial year, and Labor promised before the 2022 election that it would introduce new guidelines and streamline application processes to boost the representation of Australian suppliers. That has not happened yet, but Finance Minister Katy Gallagher told Senate estimates in February progress was expected ""very soon"". Want even more? Check out our tariffs topic page A procurement policy, alongside the existing Future Made in Australia industry investment scheme, could form part of a federal Labor bid to replicate the success of the ""Made in WA"" campaign many in the party believe was instrumental in the Cook Labor government's resounding re-election. ""We have [an] agenda that's very much about our economic resilience and making more things here in Australia,"" the PM told Melbourne's 3AW on Wednesday. ""What we need to do at times like this is have everyone back Team Australia."" Labor seized on Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's assertion that he could secure an exemption if he won government, accusing him of taking the side of the Trump administration. Mr Dutton said on Wednesday Mr Albanese was ""weak and incompetent"" and should have made additional phone calls and a personal visit to Washington to lobby the Trump administration. ""This is hopeless … I just think the prime minister has let every Australian down,"" he said. ""The Coalition government was able to negotiate an exemption largely because we were able to prosecute our argument more effectively than what Anthony Albanese can."" The prime minister says the United States, if it is a friend, needs to act in a way that reinforces ""the fact that we are friends"" after the Trump administration confirms no exemptions will be granted to US steel and aluminium tariffs on Australia. The government does not believe any additional conversations between the PM and Mr Trump would have made a difference. Trade Minister Don Farrell admitted on Wednesday he believed the Americans never intended to offer anyone an exemption. That view was echoed by former US ambassador and Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos on Wednesday, and earlier in the week by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said he believed the officials surrounding Mr Trump regretted giving Australia an exemption last time and were determined not to repeat it. The PM accused Mr Dutton of being ""opportunistic"". ""He should be backing Australia rather than backing the Trump administration,"" he told Sydney's 2GB. ""He never takes an opportunity to actually show that he's an adult and is fit to be the alternative prime minister … He knows that every single country in the world has been subject to this"". Labor minister Ed Husic, who said the tariffs were a ""dog act after over a century of friendship"", accused the Coalition of ""rubbing their hands at the misfortune of the country"". Anthony Albanese may be under attack from the Coalition, but Arthur Sinodinos knows Donald Trump well and believes the PM has taken the right approach to US tariffs.   Mr Dutton said he believed he could ""do a deal"" with the Trump administration. ""There's no question about that. We've got a lot to offer, not just in the defence material space, but obviously in financial services …"" he said. ""We will be a strong government that stands up for our national interests, that fights for our national interests and stands up for Australians."" The PM and other Labor ministers said they would continue to work for an exemption, noting the Turnbull government took nearly a year to secure one. ""We will continue to put forward a very strong case for exemption … We'll continue to engage constructively,"" Mr Albanese said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-13/albanese-urges-buy-australian-after-trump-tariffs/105044144
Gone is Albanese's softly-softly approach towards Trump,How to handle Donald Trump has become a central element of Australia's election,2025-03-13 07:02:33,"Donald Trump's decision to slap tariffs on Australian steel and aluminium will hardly crush the Australian economy but it does represent a profound moment in the relationship and has opened a stark pre-election divide between the two major parties. Gone is the softly-softly approach of the Albanese government towards Trump. The fear of poking the bear has disappeared. Labor's most senior figures lined up to unleash. This was ""unjustified"" and an act of ""economic self-harm"", said the prime minister. This was ""not the way to treat a friend and partner"", said the foreign minister. Trump had misled with his earlier talk of ""seriously considering"" an exemption for Australia, suggested the trade minister. It's a ""dog act"", said Industry Minister Ed Husic, linking this to Australia fighting alongside the US in wars over the past century. Prime minister slams Trump’s ‘unjustified’ tariffs on Australia It's hard to remember an Australian government being so publicly critical of an American president. The gloves haven't completely come off, but on the eve of an election, the decision to stop playing nice and start talking frankly gives an insight into how Labor reads the domestic public mood towards Trump. The US president often says ""tariff"" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool. To be clear, the government hasn't gone full Mark Carney. Its response hasn't reached quite the heights of the incoming Canadian prime minister, whose country is facing far more serious threats from Donald Trump, who talks about making America's northern neighbour the ""51st state"". Carney warns the Americans are after ""our resources, our water, our land, our country"". He's rallying Canadians around the flag and his popularity is climbing. Albanese believes the public mood towards Trump is also hardening in Australia. Pollsters are picking this up too. Voters are increasingly questioning the reliability of the US as an alliance partner and whether AUKUS is worth the enormous decades-long taxpayer investment. If community support for AUKUS is eroded, the deal won't survive long. ""Friends need to act in a way that reinforces to our respective populations that we are friends"", the prime minister warned after the Trump tariff decision. ""This is not a friendly act."" Australia will not be granted an exemption from the Trump administration's 25 per cent tariffs on aluminium and steel imports. (Reuters: Leah Millis) Peter Dutton, by contrast, is laying as much blame as he possibly can at the feet of Anthony Albanese for Trump's tariff decision. ""This is a bad day for Australia,"" said the opposition leader.  ""A bad day because of the decision our ally in America has made, but even worse because the prime minister is on his knees and can't even get a phone call or a meeting with the President of the United States, our closest ally."" Australia is betting all its security chips on an ally turning inwards, not least because America's own ability to fund a global security umbrella is limited. Albanese has had two phone calls with Trump since his inauguration but openly admits he was unable to secure another before this tariff decision. Not that phone calls or face-to-face meetings helped other world leaders. There have been no exemptions for anyone this time around, including the closest of US allies. This ""no exemptions"" approach has been taken in part due to the Trump team's memory of what happened when it was last in office and granted an exemption to the former Coalition government. ""When we were kind enough as a country to make those kinds of gestures to our friends"", said Trump's trade advisor Pete Navarro, ""they bit the hand that fed them and that's not going to happen again"". Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     He's previously accused Australia of reneging on assurances given under the Morrison government. Trump's formal tariff proclamation signed last month specifically noted, ""Australia has disregarded its verbal commitment to voluntarily restrain its aluminium exports to a reasonable level."" Despite this much harder line now being taken by Navarro and Trump, Dutton argues he could change the president's mind. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull clashes with the ABC as he warns Australia cannot self-censor ""for fear of offending the huge ego of Donald Trump"", and says Anthony Albanese will not be to blame if his government fails to secure tariff exemptions. ""If there's a change of government, we will do a deal with the Trump administration, there's no question about that"", the opposition leader promised. Exactly how Peter Dutton would convince Trump to do what he's done for no other leader, is unclear. Albanese would have much preferred to win a tariff exemption as Malcolm Turnbull did during the first Trump presidency. This outcome may be seen by some as a failure. The government is banking on voters appreciating this time is different. Trump is different. He's more willing to risk damaging the economy, friendships and alliances in pursuit of his tariff agenda. There's also a risk Dutton is misreading the public anxiety about Trump and overdoing the effort to blame Albanese. Ed Husic called the opposition leader an ""appeaser"", focused on scoring a political point rather than defending ""Team Australia"". It's a taste of what's to come in the campaign. How to handle Donald Trump is now a central element of this election. There's no exemption from that.

"Gaza war was 'that straw on a big camel's back', says Burke challenger",The independent going up against a 20-year veteran minister in Labor's heartland,2025-03-07 06:34:04,"When Ziad Basyouny heard about a protest unfolding at Granville Boys High School in Sydney's west, he felt compelled to join in. The students were voicing their concern after their support officer Wesam Charkawi was temporarily barred from attending the school for pushing back against the widespread condemnation and ""selective moral outrage"" of two Bankstown nurses who were captured on video threatening to harm Israeli patients. Both nurses have now been charged and the school protest that followed the incident was roundly criticised by Jewish groups and some elements of the media. But Dr Basyouny says the anger of students and parents was emblematic of a sentiment in his own community, which he's hoping to represent in federal parliament. Independent Ziad Basyouny is going up against Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke in the West Sydney seat of Watson. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) ""There is double standards and we're only treated that way because we're not politically savvy, we're not politically powerful,"" Dr Basyouny says. ""It highlights the double standards, that's making people feel that injustice, making people want change."" Within days, the dispute with the NSW Education Department was resolved and Sheikh Wesam returned to school to the cheers of students. But it hasn't quelled Dr Basyouny's frustration. The Egyptian-born GP is now attempting to unseat one of the federal government's most senior figures, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke, in the safe Labor seat of Watson. His campaign hasn't been without controversy. He's faced criticism for comments he shared on social media following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks, which he defends as a show of solidarity for the liberation of the people of Gaza. Dr Basyouny, who is based in Sydney's south-west, assesses cost of living pressures and access to better health care as the biggest issues at play in the electorate. But he also believes the government's response to the Israel-Gaza conflict has galvanised a sense of ""injustice"" among voters. ""The Gaza issue just represented that straw on a big camel's back of injustices,"" he says. ""That feeling of injustice when you have to wait eight months to have a procedure that would only wait for three months in the hospital 15 minutes away makes people feel ignored … and this is the issue that Gaza highlighted."" ""I've lived in the area all my life and some of the people running against me haven't,"" says Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke. (ABC News: Peter Garnish) The seat of Watson is considered to be Labor heartland. Tony Burke holds it with a margin of 15.2 per cent after around two decades in office. It takes in suburbs like Greenacre, Punchbowl, Belmore and Bankstown, making it one of the most diverse in the country. The electorate is also home to one of the nation's biggest Muslim populations. Nationally, about 3.2 per cent of residents listed Islam as their religion. In Watson, it's close to a quarter of the population. ""I've lived in the area all my life and some of the people running against me haven't,"" Mr Burke tells the ABC. The minister concedes that some voters in his electorate are dissatisfied with his government's response to the war in the Middle East, saying: ""There's no doubt that there's lots of people in the community who would have liked the government to take a different position."" He points to the government's call for Israel to ""exercise restraint"" following October 7 and Australia's vote at the United Nations General Assembly supporting an ""immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire"" in Gaza. ""We've had a fundamental change in our voting in the General Assembly, what we've done for aid, and what I've personally done with respect to providing safe haven for a good number of Palestinians during a horrific time,"" he says. The issue is one of the factors that has motivated some of Dr Basyouny's volunteers. Volunteers for Ziad Basyouny, Cian de Bhaldraithe and Eppy Najjarine, say they were motivated to campaign by the government's response to the war in Gaza.  Medical student Cian de Bhaldraithe, 28, has lived in Lakemba his whole life. He says he was aghast at Labor's reaction to the war in Gaza. ""I think it's been shameful how our government's enabled such truly indescribable brutality and I think anybody you ask, they'd want to do what they can to make sure we're not continuing to enable that,"" he says. Teacher and single mother Eppy Narjarrine echoed that sentiment. ""I feel that they're [the government] complicit,"" she says. ""They haven't been strong enough in their stance, that they just give, it's like more tokenism. 'Oh yes, we'll recognise Palestine as a state' … is, like, a bit too late."" Ms Narjarrine says she and her family have always voted Labor, but that will change at this election. Unseating a 20-year veteran of a safe seat is no small task — but it's also not without precedent. Just ask former prime minister Tony Abbott, who lost his blue-ribbon seat of Warringah after 25 years to independent Zali Steggall. Election analyst John Black expects Mr Burke to hold Watson, along with fellow cabinet minister Jason Clare in the equally diverse neighbouring electorate of Blaxland. But he argues voter discontent over the Israel-Gaza war could be more dangerous for the government in a marginal seat like Parramatta. ""It's going to make a bigger impact, I suspect, in the marginals, more so than the safer Labor seats,"" Mr Black says. Australians could head to the polls in a federal election within months. So when will it be and what are the key seats in the battle to lead the country? He points to the election in the United Kingdom last year, when UK Labour lost a handful of seats to pro-Palestinian candidates and where about 20 per cent of the population identifies as Muslim. ""It all depends on how angry they are and how much loyalty there is to the local member as a long-standing MP for the area where they've been able to establish links and so on,"" he says. ""What we saw in the UK during their elections were swings against the British Labour Party of up to 35 per cent — they were huge. ""A great chunk of the Muslim vote just broke away from the British Labor Party in protest at what they saw was a lack of support."" Fellow GP and community leader Jamal Rifi agrees with Dr Basyouny's diagnosis that there is a clear sense of community dissatisfaction at Labor's response to the war. But his treatment plan is different. He argues Mr Burke remains best placed to represent the electorate, starting a ""Friends of Tony Burke"" campaign to help the incumbent's re-election effort. ""There will be a backlash and there is great dissatisfaction, but people also have been influenced by different parties towards having negativity towards the Labor Party,"" Dr Rifi says. He alleges that independents like Dr Basyouny are conflating the issues. ""They're riding on the wave of pain of what's happening overseas and just wanted to canvas the votes based on the pain that we have,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, our pain has clouded some people's judgement, but has not clouded my political judgement. We know what's best for the community, and we will work for what's best for the community, not for individuals who are opportunistic."" Mr Burke also cautions voters to consider the Coalition's position on the Israel-Gaza conflict before deciding their vote, warning that Labor losing seats could install Opposition Leader Peter Dutton as prime minister. ""For every frustration that some people will feel, Peter Dutton is worse on and demonstrably so,"" he says. ""He didn't think anybody from that part of the world should be coming to Australia at all. ""The day after the election, either Peter Dutton will be prime minister or Anthony Albanese will be prime minister … if they choose not to vote for me, which is their democratic right, then that opens the way for Peter Dutton. ""That's the mathematical reality of it."" When the ABC interviewed Mr Burke for this story, he had just presided over one of several mass citizenship ceremonies in Sydney, a move that was criticised by the opposition as a pre-election vote grab in marginal outer-suburban seats. Mr Burke, who is also the immigration minister, has defended the blitz on the basis that the government was clearing a ""huge backlog"" of prospective citizens who had been fully processed and were awaiting ceremonies. Nationally, about 3.2 per cent of residents listed Islam as their religion. In Watson, it's close to a quarter of the population.  (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) Dr Basyouny, himself Muslim, is one of a number of independent candidates running in Western Sydney seats. He insists his religion doesn't define his candidacy. ""I'm a Muslim. It's a part of my identity and a part of me. But that has nothing to do with the fact that I'm a Watson candidate,"" he says. While he has received the backing of groups like the Muslim Vote and Muslim Votes Matter, he insists: ""I'm not the Muslim Vote or the Muslim Vote Matters candidate."" A new political organisation plans to unseat Labor MPs in a 'teal-style' campaign capitalising on Muslim community anger over the government's Gaza stance. He faced criticism last year after he shared a controversial Facebook post in the days following the October 7 Hamas attacks. The original, translated post reads: ""Dreams, my friend, come true for those who seek and work to see them come true!"". It appears to reference the First Intifada in 1987 with an illustration of a person throwing rocks and the 2023 Hamas attacks with a paraglider firing a machine gun. At the time, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chair Alex Ryvchin condemned the posts and suggested Dr Basyouny was unfit to hold office. ""Anyone who takes pride in such acts is a danger to our society and manifestly unfit to stand as a candidate for any office,"" he told the Nine newspapers. Asked about the post, Dr Basyouny says it was not supporting the attack on civilians but instead expressing solidarity against oppression ""As a human, as a doctor, as a Muslim … attacks on civilians is not to be condoned, accepted or in any shape or form,"" he says. ""There was a celebration of the liberation of the people of Gaza from that 20 years incarceration in their biggest prison on earth."" With the local campaign already underway, the spotlight on the once-unremarkable contest will only intensify as polling day approaches. Both candidates agree that the cost of living is at the front of mind for voters in the electorate. ""The issues that happened over the past couple of years where you feel that Labor is not listening, cost of living, people are in agony under the cost of living issues,"" Dr Basyouny says. Mr Burke says it is the number one issue brought up with him. ""You've got to remember, when people are considering cost of living, they're not looking at the national statistics. What they're looking at is what's happening in their supermarkets and what's happening in their bank accounts, what's happening with rent, what's happening with mortgages,"" he says. ""The government's been fighting, and I've been fighting, on every one of those issues for it is at risk."" For grocer Mohammad Rafiq, the cost of living is front of mind. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) For undecided voters like Mohammad Rafiq, it feels like his daily reality has only been getting harder. Over the last couple of years, the local grocer has struggled with the soaring costs of rent and electricity to run his business in Lakemba. ""Business is very quiet, very low and [I must] spend a lot … Rent is more than $5,000, now more than $8,000,"" he says. ""It's too much cost.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-07/ziad-basyouny-tony-burke-labor-watson-election/105018700
PM leaves door open to calling election in days after cyclone,Prime minister leaves door open to calling election in days after Tropical Cyclone Alfred,2025-03-06 13:17:01,"The prime minister has left himself the option of calling the election this weekend, as Tropical Cyclone Alfred bears down on Queensland and northern NSW. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese must call an election to be held by May 17, and this weekend was considered a favoured date to do so. If he triggered a standard five week campaign it would mean an April 12 polling date — avoiding the need to deliver a federal budget and holding the vote before the Anzac and Easter holidays. But the development of a category two cyclone off Australia's east coast has threatened to spoil the opportunity to call an election this weekend. Mr Albanese has already put off plans to travel to Perth to celebrate the expected Labor victory in this weekend's WA state election. But asked repeatedly on Sky whether he would heed calls to delay calling an election, Mr Albanese would not be boxed in. ""I'm focused not on votes, I’m focused on lives, I'm focused on Australians,"" Mr Albanese said. ""I've been focused on three years for governing. I’ve said the same thing every time I've been asked. ""These are questions that have been asked this week, this month, last month, the month before, they have been asked for a period of time."" If the cyclone makes landfall sometime on Friday as expected, it would leave Mr Albanese with three days to assess the damage and determine whether an election could be called without significant backlash. If Mr Albanese wants to call an election for April 12, he must do so before 6pm on Monday. However the prime minister made clear that was not the issue on his mind. “My thoughts are really with the people who are preparing [in Queensland and northern NSW],"" he said. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton urged the prime minister to delay calling an election in wake of the cyclone, saying doing so would be ""tin-eared"". Have you been affected by Cyclone Alfred?

Labor pitches $1b freeway upgrade to Melbourne's west ahead of election,Labor pitches $1b Western Freeway upgrade to Melbourne's west as federal election looms,2025-03-06 12:28:27,"The federal and Victorian Labor governments have announced $1.1 billion in funding ahead of the federal election to finish a planned upgrade of the Western Highway. The bulk of the funding — about $1 billion — is a sweetener for voters in Melbourne's western suburbs — an upgrade to the freeway section of the highway between the outer suburbs of Melton and Caroline Springs. The bulk of the funding has been committed to upgrades of the Western Freeway between Melton and Caroline Springs. (ABC News: Ashmitaa Thiruselvam) In the Ballarat suburb of Warrenheip, $100 million will be spent on planning upgrades to the highway's intersection with Brewery Tap road. And more than $6 million has been allocated to strengthen the Dimboola Bridge over the Melbourne-Adelaide railway line and Dadswells Bridge over the Mt William Creek flood plain, between Stawell and the South Australian border. Construction of the bridge upgrades is expected to start this year, and be completed by the end of 2026. The Western Highway near Ararat. (ABC Ballarat: Dominic Cansdale) Victoria is shaping up to be a significant battle ground in the federal election. Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Catherine King said the Western Highway through Melbourne's outer suburbs was a key priority for Labor.  Catherine King with Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles in Ballarat this year. (Supplied) Ms King said significant housing development and population growth around Melton and Caroline Springs had choked roads. Approximately 86,000 vehicles travel the stretch of highway between Melton and Caroline Springs each day, and that figure is predicted to grow to more than 100,000 by 2031. Labor says upgrading the Western Freeway through Melbourne's outer suburbs is a key priority. (Supplied: Engage Victoria) ""The West Gate Tunnel will alleviate some of that [concern], but the road is really not in a condition to deal with that volume of traffic, there."" The intersection near Ballarat was known to be dangerous, she said. ""We've had multiple complaints, and near-misses, we know that needs to be solved."" The minister denied the funding announcement was designed to lure voters ahead of the federal election. ""We're making this as a decision of government — we are not in an election campaign yet,"" she said. ""So, that will appear in the pre-election financial outlook."" Some of the works are still in the business case planning stage. Ms King said overpasses and interchange works might take some time to get off the ground, whereas some re-sealing and widening of road shoulders would be quicker to start and complete. Bridget McKenzie, the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, said the Coalition would match Labor's promise to fund the roadworks if it won the election. ""This investment is a key component in our plan to support congested outer-western suburbs … anyone that's driven the Western Highway knows it is a growing concern … there just has not been the investment in infrastructure that's required,"" she said. Senator McKenzie said the proposed upgrades were flagged years ago and announcing funding in the lead-up to the election was opportunistic.

Ousted CFMEU officials funding ads attacking Labor in marginal seats,Ousted CFMEU officials funding ads attacking Labor in marginal seats,2025-03-06 05:31:28,"Ousted CFMEU officials are targeting Labor MPs in marginal electorates with social media attack ads that a political analyst says could help the Coalition pick up seats in this year's federal election. Your Union Your Future, a group set up by CFMEU officials dumped when the union was forced into administration last year, is running multiple ads on Facebook and Instagram attacking Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and individual Labor MPs and candidates in 12 seats around the country. The ads feature the slogan, ""Compare the Pair … Same Policies, Different Names"", accompanied by digitally altered images of Mr Albanese standing alongside Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and various Labor MPs.  Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. ""Anthony Albanese and Labor's Fiona Phillips MP are no different from the Liberals,"" says one ad targeting the member for the NSW seat of Gilmore, which Labor holds with a 0.2 per cent margin. ""Both parties supported anti-union laws that stripped away workers' rights. This election, send a clear message in Gilmore — your vote can't be taken for granted!"" The ads also target Victorian MP Jodie Belyea and the Northern Territory's Marion Scrymgour, who both hold their seats by tiny margins. The Your Union Your Choice ad targeting Labor's candidate for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips. (Facebook) Data from Facebook and Instagram owner Meta shows the ads have been seen by users up to 400,000 times since they were launched in early February. Your Union Your Choice has spent more than $10,000 on targeted ads on the platforms. The ads highlight the willingness of ousted CFMEU officials to actively campaign against Labor over its decision to pass legislation last year appointing an administrator to the union. That move, which was supported by the opposition, was triggered by media reports the CFMEU had been infiltrated by bikies and organised criminals. CFMEU officials have denied any involvement in criminal activity. During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help. In all but one of the seats featured in the Your Union Your Choice ads, Labor's main opponent is a Coalition candidate. The only exception is the Melbourne seat of Wills, where Labor MP Peter Khalil's main challenger is Greens candidate Samantha Ratnam. Redbridge pollster and former Labor official Kos Samaras says the seats being targeted by the advertising campaign are among the most vulnerable for Labor in the election. ""The list of seats that this group is looking at were already on the list of seats that we expect to go down to the wire,"" he said. ""These are all critical seats. So, a campaign of this nature is just going to make the job harder for Labor."" Former Labor official Kos Samaras says the Your Union Your Voice campaign will make it harder for Labor to hold onto power. (Peter Healy, file photo) Peter Dutton has vowed to deregister the CFMEU if the Coalition wins the election. He has also promised to reinstate the Australian Building and Construction Commission — a body long opposed by the union and which was abolished after Labor came to power in 2022. Your Union Your Choice did not respond to questions about its advertising campaign and its potential to benefit the opposition. The group was set up in August last year by former CFMEU Queensland and Northern Territory branch secretary Michael Ravbar and former assistant secretaries Jade Ingham and Kane Lowth. In September, the group launched a High Court challenge to the forced administration. The High Court is yet to deliver its judgement in the case. No system is 100 per cent secure, but the Signal app can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions of the app to work out if it is the best method of communication for you. Your Union Your Choice has also launched a fundraising and social media campaign, which regularly features videos of Mr Ravbar and Mr Ingham railing against CFMEU administrator Mark Irving KC. ""The issues of criminality and corruption, no one has ever been charged, there's no credible evidence,"" Mr Ravbar said in a video posted to the group's Instagram account last week. Despite the group's prominent social media presence, the campaign targeting individual Labor MPs has not been featured on any of its public-facing social media accounts. Instead, data from Meta shows it has been targeted at specific users, predominantly older men. ""Or [they may have] social networks that are attached to somebody who works in that industry or has a membership of that particular union."" ""This is a group that is already aggrieved about politics. It just adds another layer to their grievance,"" Mr Samaras said. A version of the ad that only features Mr Albanese standing beside Mr Dutton has been posted on the group's social media pages. The ads come as former CFMEU Victorian secretary John Setka this week described Mr Albanese as ""weak as piss"" in an interview with Melbourne broadcaster Neil Mitchell. Mr Setka, who quit the union last year, said he would not vote Labor in the election. Federal Minister for Workplace Relations Murray Watt played down the potential impact of the ads. ""It is unsurprising that these ads, and a High Court challenge, have been launched by disgruntled former leaders of the union,"" he said in a statement. ""The administrator and his team continue to make good progress in cleaning up the CFMEU and ensuring its members are well represented."" Griffith University political analyst Paul Williams said the Your Union Your Choice campaign did not appear to be designed to direct votes to the Coalition, but to ""cause mischief"" and put the CFMEU administration on the agenda during the election campaign. ""It's very eager to galvanise support for itself, public sympathy, and lean on Labor,"" he said.

Politicians heckled for misinformation about Bathurst 1000 closure,Politicians cop criticism for misinformation on threat to Bathurst 1000,2025-03-06 12:30:40,"A political candidate vying for the federal seat of Calare has been heckled after being accused of spreading misinformation and inciting racism over suggestions the Bathurst 1000 race is at risk from an Aboriginal heritage application.  Nationals candidate Sam Farraway and sitting independent MP Andrew Gee alleged an application for a sacred site on Mount Panorama-Wahluu would restrict access to the mountain. Mr Farraway has also launched a petition titled Save Mount Panorama in which he claims the move by the Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation (WTOCWAC) ""could spell the death of the Bathurst 1000"", the annual motor racing event. ""If approved it could lock up sections of the mountain, restrict public access, and put the future of the great race at risk,"" Mr Farraway said. ""The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 needs urgent reform to stop it from being weaponised."" A text message sent out encourage people to sign a petition organised by Nationals' candidae for Calare Sam Farraway. (Supplied) His campaign sent out text messages urging people to sign the petition.  But the ABC has confirmed with the Federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) that no such application has been made under the act. When addressing a pensioners and superannuants forum in Bathurst on Thursday, Mr Farraway was asked about spreading misinformation. Nationals' candidate for Calare Sam Farraway at a candidates' forum in Bathurst on Thursday. (ABC Central West: Lani Oataway) In response, he doubled down on his stance and appeared to blame Bathurst Regional Council's general manager David Sherley.  ""The general manager of our very own council confirmed to the media that there are active discussions, that there is active dialogue with members of the community about quarantining more area on top of Mount Panorama,"" Mr Farraway said.  Members of the audience could be heard yelling ""shame on you Sam"", ""bullshit"" and ""rubbish"" as he made the remarks.  In response to a question from a councillor at Wednesday night's Bathurst council meeting, Mr Sherley said he was unaware of discussions to lodge a heritage application. ""No declaration of the area being an Aboriginal place has been made, nor to my awareness has an application to reconsider that been made in the last couple of years,"" Mr Sherley said.  He also confirmed that no protection orders were being discussed under federal legislation.  In a statement a spokesperson for the NSW DCCEEW said, ""Heritage NSW is not aware of any current or planned restrictions to access Mount Panorama-Wahluu for heritage restrictions."" Mr Farraway and Mr Gee made the comments following media reports that claimed that Mount Panorama had been the subject of the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System (AHIMS). A spokesperson for the NSW DCCEEW said while the site had been registered on AHIMS since 2022 ""it is categorised as 'not a site' due to insufficient information being provided"". ""Inclusion on AHIMS does not provide protection of a location,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Sherley told councillors ""discussions are continuing"" between staff and the WTOCWAC surrounding the AHIMS application.  The annual Bathurst 1000 at Mount Panorama-Wahluu draws tens of thousands of fans. (AAP: Murray McCloskey) At Thursday's forum, Mr Farraway, a former NSW MLC, also raised the fact that the WTOCWAC was the same group that lodged a section 10 application on land within the proposed McPhillamys Gold Project near Blayney. Last year, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek granted an Aboriginal protection order over the site of the mine's tailings dam, which would have been built at the headwaters of the Belubula River. The ABC had made repeated attempts to contact Mr Farraway and has also contacted federal Nationals leader David Littleproud prior to publication and did not receive a response. According to the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council there are more than 110,000 sacred sites declared across the state under the AHIMS. In a statement in response to the claims by Mr Farraway the WTOCWAC said it was ""dismayed"" and ""appalled"" at his claim. ""In the lead up to the federal election it appears some commentators are targeting us,"" the corporation said. ""[It's] an attempt to revive the culture wars and to garner votes from people who would prefer to listen to sensationalist misinformation. ""To community members who have been affected by the disrespectful discourse … we encourage you to simply not engage with racist commentary."" McPhillamy Park sits at the top of Mount Panorama-Wahluu and is the site of an AHIMS application. (ABC Central West: Mollie Gorman) The corporation said it had always maintained ""Wiradyuri culture and motor racing can respectfully coexist at Wahluu"". The organisation said it was exploring its options regarding the ""publication of false, misleading, and defamatory information about our corporation and its members"". The Independent federal member for Calare Andrew Gee defected from the Nationals in 2022 over its stance on the Indigenous Voice to Parliament.  He also criticised the WTOCWAC in a social media post on Tuesday afternoon. ""I'm opposed to the registration of Mount Panorama as a state heritage site,"" the independent MP said. ""I'm also opposed to any restrictions to accessing the top of the mountain or any other part of it."" A current independent MP for Calare, Andrew Gee, has backed down from his initial comments. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) After speaking with the First Nations group, in an interview with the ABC Mr Gee backed down from his initial comments. ""They're not trying to stop motor racing or restrict it in anyway,"" he said. ""I am really pleased that has been cleared up."" Speaking at the forum on Thursday Mr Gee said the entire issue had highlighted the need for law reform.  Fellow independent candidate Kate Hook criticised Mr Farraway and Mr Gee over their comments.

It comes after police released vision of two men stealing political posters belonging to Calare MP Andrew Gee. Mr Gee, who represented the electorate for the Nationals for three terms, is seeking re-election as an Independent after defecting from the major party over its stance on the Indigenous Voice to Parliament. He has been the target of corflute theft during the past month between the central western townships of Wellington and Lucknow, including Orange.  Police are searching for two males who could be seen stealing one of the MPs campaign posters from outside the Orange Aboriginal Corporation Health Service in Orange on Tuesday last week.  One of the men was wielding a cutting instrument.  Police said they believed the males left the Peisley Street scene in a grey dual cab ute from shortly after 7.45pm. Mr Gee says his corflute was stolen from a fence in Orange. (ABC Central West: Toby Hemmings) Police also said they were call after a man removed Mr Gee's posters from a lawyer's office later that same night, about 10pm. Police said an unknown male in a black Ford Ranger began removing posters from a law office on William Street before an altercation ensued between the man and solicitor Toby Tancred, who was inside during the alleged theft.  Andrew Gee claims the wheels of his campaign trailer have been stolen. (Supplied: Andrew Gee) It is understood the man left with two other males shortly after.  Officers are urging anyone with information or footage to come forward.  Mr Gee said one of his campaign trailers had wheels and posters stolen from it on Monday night.  ""I am very shocked that this is continuing in the midst of an ongoing police investigation,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to have deterred these people at all. Meanwhile, Mr Gee's Nationals replacement, Sam Farraway, has been the target of anti-semitic graffitti on a billboard in the region.  Swastikas were found drawn onto Mr Farraway's hoardings in January. Mr Farraway's campaign also claims it has been targeted with people trespassing on private property to destroy signs.  Fellow Calare candidate, Kate Hook, said wheels had recently been stolen from one of her campaign trailers, which was owned by a volunteer.  Police are investigating the incident.  Ms Hook ran against Mr Gee in the previous 2022 federal election. She took 40 per cent of the two-candidate-preferred vote which resulted in the Nationals suffering a 3.6 per cent swing in their stronghold seat.  ""It's not actually hurting the candidate if that's the person's intention,"" Ms Hook said.  ""It's actually hurting the volunteer who has offered to help."" Kate Hook says her campaign posters have been slashed and graffitied.  (Supplied: Kate Hook) Ms Hook said the issues did not arise during her previous campaign.  ""I feel like this is new,"" she said.  In a separate incident, CCTV vision shows a person attempting to remove posters of Ms Hook from one of her trailers in Orange on Saturday.

'I am everywhere': Labor MP bullish despite NT electorate shake-up,NT seats of Solomon and Lingiari change boundaries ahead of federal election,2025-03-04 18:08:30,"Thousands of Northern Territory voters will be shifted into the federal seat of Solomon, with a shake-up to electoral boundaries coming into effect ahead of the federal election. The redistribution moves about 2,000 households, or 5,000 voters, from the seat of Lingiari into the Top End electorate of Solomon, which has been won by Labor at the past three federal elections. The boundary shuffle takes in suburbs which swung big towards the Country Liberal Party (CLP) at last year's NT election, including the electorate of NT Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro. As at February 2024, there were more than 72,000 enrolled voters in Solomon. The suburbs of Farrar, Johnston, Mitchell, Zuccoli and part of the industrial suburb of Yarrawonga will now fall into Solomon, to sit with the rest of Darwin and Palmerston. While Solomon is traditionally a swing seat, its incumbent Labor MP Luke Gosling has held the electorate for a record three terms. Luke Gosling won Solomon by a two-candidate preferred margin of more than 9 per cent in 2022. (ABC News: Dane Hirst) Mr Gosling said he was unfazed by the boundary changes and welcomed the voters from Palmerston, which he said were once a part of the seat before a previous redistribution. ""I don't know if you've noticed, but in the work that I do as the member for Solomon, I am everywhere,"" Mr Gosling told the ABC. ""All over Palmerston, all over Darwin, northern suburbs. ""So, people in those suburbs, not only have I already represented them, I'm so proud and ready to represent them formally in the federal parliament."" The CLP's Solomon candidate Lisa Bayliss said both Mr Gosling and Territory Labor had ""for too long taken the territory for granted"". Lisa Bayliss is the CLP's candidate for Solomon. (ABC News: Hamish Harty) At last year's NT election in August, Ms Finocchiaro gained a 16.1 per cent swing in her seat of Spillett. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has previously said a CLP win in Solomon could be key to an overall Coalition victory in the upcoming federal election. Peter Dutton says Solomon is a target seat for the Coalition. (AAP: Steven Markham) In the 2022 federal election, Mr Gosling increased his two-candidate preferred margin in Solomon to 9.4 per cent, beating former pastoralist and CLP candidate Tina MacFarlane. Also in the race for Solomon, independent candidate Phil Scott has been out hitting the streets of Darwin and Palmerston in preparation for the campaign. ""The major parties treat our democracy like a horse race, when actually people want real policy innovation to solve our high costs of living, to build a strong local economy underpinned by small business, and to keep our community safe by investing in families,"" Mr Scott said. Phil Scott says he's been ""blown away"" by support from people who want to vote independent. (ABC News: Pete Garnish) In a statement on Tuesday, Australian Electoral Commission NT manager Geoff Bloom said the federal election could be announced any day, and needed to be held in April or May. ""With a federal election coming it is important that voters know whether they'll be voting in either Lingiari or Solomon for the House of Representatives,"" Mr Bloom said. ""There will be an automatic change made on their enrolment record but the action required by voters is simply to know what their seat is ahead of time so they can be prepared when they're thinking about who they might vote for."" The ABC has reported Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has all but settled on holding an election on April 12, but the campaign launch could be delayed due to the potential impact of Cyclone Alfred off the eastern seaboard.

You told us there is an increasing sense of despair that social cohesion is being eroded by the increasing divide between those who have property and those who feel shut out of the housing market. And you told us of your trust being fatigued, of social inequality and your fears for the future. You said you want more transparent governance. Lynda Paterson from Eden in NSW says she doesn't expect to vote for either major party.

And Robin from Northcote in Melbourne told us ""climate change remains the most pressing matter of our time"". ""Despite the real and significant impact of cost of living, it will change. Whereas if we do nothing about the rapid rate of climate change the human race is stuffed."" Robin also expressed concern about democracy.  ""It is being undermined on many fronts and we should be asking investigative questions of candidates about what they believe in terms of democratic processes and consider how past governments have respected, or not, these processes.""

Is Labor pork-barrelling with its urgent care clinics?,Opposition says 'no question' government funding urgent care clinics to woo voters,2025-03-03 17:01:36,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has pledged almost $10 billion in health announcements in recent days, as he seeks to win a second term in office. But his most recent pledge — to build an additional 50 urgent care clinics across the country — is facing opposition criticism his government is spending taxpayer funds to woo voters ahead of the election. While insisting it supports urgent care clinics, the Coalition is yet to commit to matching Labor's $650 million pledge. But Opposition Leader Peter Dutton told reporters there was ""no question"" the government was pork-barrelling to win votes. The ABC has analysed the 137 proposed and current locations of the clinics to determine their locations electorally. Let's take a closer look. The 50 proposed and 87 delivered clinics are fairly evenly distributed across the country geographically. When you consider parties, just under two-thirds of the 137 clinics are in Labor seats. About a quarter of the centres are in Coalition seats and the remainder are split between the Greens and independents. Of the clinics already open, around a quarter are in electorates on margins of under 5 per cent. Whereas when you look at the extra 50 clinics promised at the weekend, about half are in electorates with a margin of under 5 per cent. Mr Dutton has accused Labor of pledging clinics in locations that could deliver a political advantage for the government. ""There's no question that Labor's pork-barrelling, have a look at the map as to where these clinics have gone,"" he said. ""The AMA (Australian Medical Association) and others have been critical about these clinics. Health Minister Mark Butler dismissed the pork-barrelling accusation as a ""beat up"". ""If you look at the 50 seats I announced yesterday, about half of them are in Labor held seats, and half of them are in non-Labor held seats, which reflects the makeup of the parliament,"" he said. ""The important point though, is that these locations have been chosen according to our analysis of hospital presentations in local hospitals, bulk-billing data, and a desire to ensure an even geographical spread. For example, here in Queensland, there will be, if we're elected, 26 urgent care clinics, 21 of which are currently in non-Labor held seats."" About 15 clinics are small clinics in the Northern Territory and ACT, which Mr Butler notes are jurisdictions without any Liberal MPs. He also said the NSW and Victorian governments handed over the operation of some of their clinics in a separate deal last year, which meant the government had inherited clinics he didn't decide the locations of. ""If you remove those anomalies, which is almost 30 of the 87, the remaining clinics that have gone through our selection process have fallen about half Labor, half non-Labor held seats,"" he said. ""Our site selection has nothing to do with the political colour of an electorate. It has everything to do with hospital presentation data, bulk-billing data, and that desire to ensure a geographical spread."" Health Minister Mark Butler said urgent care clinic locations were decided on need. (ABC News: Kate Nickels) Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, or UCCs, are designed to take pressure off emergency departments by treating people with illnesses or injuries which are urgent, but not life threatening. That could be something like gastroenteritis, a broken bone or a respiratory illness — things where you're too unwell or hurt to wait for treatment, but don't necessarily need to go to the hospital for. They're usually run by GPs who work alongside nurses and other health care professionals like radiographers, and are open outside of work hours. The clinics are walk-in, which means you don't need an appointment, and they're bulk-billed — so you don't have to pay out-of-pocket costs when you go. Labor perceives these clinics as popular with voters, providing them with free and accessible healthcare outside of a hospital. A new network of urgent care clinics was central to Labor's last election campaign, and it's built 87 in this term of government. On the weekend it promised to build 50 new clinics by mid-next year. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the introduction of the additional clinics would make them more accessible for the public. ""Four in five Australians will live within a 20-minute drive of a bulk-billed Medicare Urgent Care Clinic once all Labor's clinics are open,"" he said. Independent MP Monique Ryan and the Royal Australian College of GPs have called for an independent evaluation of the clinics — due next year — to be released before further clinics are built. Dr Ryan said the government needed to be sure they were cost-effective and improving care. ""Healthcare is too important to be used for pork-barrelling,"" she said. ""It's estimated that a visit to an Urgent Care Clinic costs $285, in comparison to $65 for an ordinary GP visit. That money is going to large corporate medical centre providers.  Kooyong MP Monique Ryan says there is still no objective evidence to suggest the urgent care clinics are the best value for money. (ABC News: Kristian Silva) RACGP President Michael Wright also questioned whether the government was prescribing the right fix for an overburdened health system. ""We've now had more than a billion dollars invested into these clinics but we still don't have an evaluation that would let us know are they providing value for money and are they keeping people out of hospital, and that's what we need,"" he said. Mr Butler said an evaluation had been commissioned and was due to be released in 2026, but said in the interim there was ""no doubt"" the program was working. ""It is delivering for Australians, and it is having a material impact on our hospital system,"" he said while unveiling the policy on Sunday. ""For the first time in anyone's memory I suspect, category four and five presentations to EDs — so that is the semi-urgent and non-urgent presentations that this model targets — have flatlined across the country, in spite of the fact that this network is by no means ubiquitous.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-03/labor-medicare-urgent-care-clinic-pork-barrelling/105004306
"In Melbourne's west, cost-of-living pressures could sway key contests","In Melbourne's west, cost-of-living pressures could sway crucial election contests",2025-03-03 05:44:21,"Lazar Karanovic has lived in Melbourne's west for most of his life. From Werribee to Altona North, it's now the suburb of St Albans that he's called home for the past five years — but he's beginning to fall out of love. ""I shouldn't complain, but it's no good,"" Mr Karanovic said. St Albans resident Lazar Karanovic has concerns about the rising cost of living. (ABC News: Leanne Wong) From increased grocery prices to the cost of housing, he says concerns over living expenses are why he's ultimately decided not to have a family. ""That's the only reason I broke up with my ex. Because she wanted a family, and I said no."" With a federal election looming, cost-of-living pressure is among the key issues likely to be on voters' minds as they head to the ballot box. St Albans sits in the seat of Fraser and is generally regarded as Labor heartland, along with the nearby seats of Hawke, Gorton, Lalor and Calwell. But polling suggests that this election, voting patterns in some historically safe Labor seats across Melbourne's outer suburbs may be shifting, producing political contests that could help decide the next government. One of the clearest indications that the cost of living is biting in St Albans is the suburb's at-times thriving, and persistent, black market grocery trade. A recent police crackdown saw 14 people arrested for allegedly stealing meat from supermarkets and re-selling the products at lower prices on local footpaths. Police said the rising coast of living had forced some people to turn to crime in St Albans. (ABC News: Sharon Gordon) Brimbank Local Area Commander, Inspector Matthew Bui, told ABC Radio Melbourne he was unsurprised by the volume of people involved in the illegal trade, given the rising cost of living. ""What concerns me is the preying on vulnerable people,"" he said. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. At the Loaves and Fishes food bank in St Albans, volunteer Regina Cutchma helps offer meal support to more than 250 households each week. She said all sorts of people in her community were seeking help, including people experiencing homelessness and couch surfing. ""People sleep in their cars because they've got nowhere to go to sleep … one lady said she goes from one place to another place to another place,"" Ms Cutchma said. Fellow volunteer Laura Kretiuk said there was no doubt in recent years the charity had become busier and resources were stretched. ""The food parcels are getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. A melting pot of different cultures, St Albans is home to people from across the globe, including Vietnam, India, the Philippines and Malta. More than a quarter of residents have Vietnamese ancestry, with the suburb bursting with Vietnamese restaurants and grocery stores. For local John Le Bui, inflation isn't measured by the price of a cup of coffee, but the cost of a banh mi (a Vietnamese sandwich roll). Public transport is a key issue for St Albans teacher John Le Bui. (ABC News: Leanne Wong) ""It was a few years ago when everyone was in an uproar when banh mis were $5,"" Mr Le Bui said. ""It doesn't seem like a whole lot, but now going from $5 to $8 — that's a 60 per cent increase in price. My pay hasn't increased by 60 per cent."" Mr Le Bui works as a high school teacher in the nearby suburb of Caroline Springs. He said he frequently saw his students, especially those in single-parent households, battle with getting to school and work on time due to a lack of infrastructure. ""A lot of the kids really struggle with public transportation. Especially in the outer west, near Caroline Springs, Tarneit, Truganina, where it's a lot of urban sprawl,"" Mr Le Bui said. Access to public transport was a key issue for some people the ABC spoke to at St Albans. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica) It's a common complaint, and one that was raised repeatedly during the Victorian by-election for Werribee, where the state Labor party was confronted with accusations it had neglected the west. The party suffered a double-digit swing against it in an area that was Labor heartland, but ultimately managed to cling onto the seat. Last week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Melbourne and pledged $2 billion in funding to upgrade Sunshine station in Melbourne's west, a key part of the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link. He also pledged funding to go towards the electrification of the railway line out to Melton. Back in St Albans, Ms Kretiuk hopes all politicians hoping to form the next government can better understand the cost-of-living pressures she sees in her community daily.

'Pro-China' Dutton seeking to woo back crucial voters,Politicians turn to community festivals and the Little Red Book to sway Chinese-Australian voters,2025-03-02 11:09:43,"Anthony Albanese looked to be revelling as he made his way through the crowd. Wearing a red tie, he posed for selfies, shook hands and waved to the tens of thousands around him in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood. He painted a similar picture in a red tie a week earlier, this time in the Melbourne suburb of Box Hill. The scenes, the prime minister said, reflected modern Australia. ""Lunar New Year is part of our calendar,"" Albanese said at a press conference in the days between the two suburban outings. ""It's not something that's confined now to just people who have come from China, from Vietnam, from other parts of Asia, from Korea, to Australia to celebrate. ""We have an incredible privilege in this country to learn, participate and celebrate the cultural diversity not just of our country but the entire world, right here in our own backyard."" Anthony Albanese, Dai Le and Peter Dutton were all in western Sydney for Lunar new year this year. (ABC News: Simon Amery) Albanese clearly enjoyed himself, boasting about it when he addressed Labor's caucus days back in Canberra. The prime minister told his troops he enjoyed campaigning, insisting he was out meeting people on the street at a third event in the Sydney suburb of Fairfield while Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was at a VIP drinks event. ""[He] doesn't like engaging with people,"" Albanese told caucus. Be it street walks or VIP drinks, there are few events that bring both Albanese and Dutton together outside Parliament House. That the two leaders would be at three events together across consecutive weekends underscores the battle they're in to woo Chinese-Australian voters, a key demographic that could be instrumental in the looming election. There are many reasons why Scott Morrison and the Coalition were dismissed from power three years ago. Among them was a perception, rightly or wrongly, that the Coalition was anti-China. Liberal analysis of the defeat found the swing against the party was significantly greater in electorates with a high concentration of voters with Chinese ancestry. The review found in the top 15 seats with Chinese-Australian voters, the swing on a two-party-preferred basis was 6.6 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in other seats. ""There were a number of reasons for this, including a perception the previous government's criticisms of the CCP government of China included the wider Chinese community more generally,"" the review found. You need only look to Labor's first caucus meeting after that election to see all the new MPs who'd won Liberal seats thanks to Chinese-Australian voter support. Sam Lim, centre, Carina Garland, second from right, and Jerome Laxale, right, won seats with high proportions of Chinese-Australian voters at the last election. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) The most recent census estimated around 1.4 million residents identified as having Chinese ancestry, representing about 5.5 per cent of the population. In some electorates, however, the number of people who identify as having Chinese ancestry is close to 30 per cent, for example the Melbourne electorate of Menzies. First-term MP Keith Wolahan was a special forces commando and barrister before turning his hand to politics. He beat long-term Liberal MP Kevin Andrews in pre-selection and went on to win what had once been a safe seat with a 0.7 per cent margin at the 2022 election. A redistribution in electoral boundaries has notionally given his seat to Labor. Peter and Kirilly Dutton walked in a Lunar New Year parade in Box Hill this year. (Instagram) Part of the reason it's now a notional Labor seat is because his electorate now takes in a greater proportion of Box Hill, a suburb with a high Chinese-Australian population. In 2022, Menzies was the electorate with the third-highest number of Chinese-Australians. Today, it's the highest. Neighbouring Chisholm, which Labor also won at the last election, is now second. The neighbouring Sydney electorates of Bradfield, Reid and Bennelong make up the next three electorates for Chinese-Australian voters. Add in Melbourne electorate of Kooyong and the Perth seat of Tangney, which also have high Chinese ancestry, and you can see how the Coalition lost power. Before the election the Liberals held all seven. After the poll, it held just two. More broadly, of the 20 electorates considered in play this election, at least half of them have a Chinese-Australian population that is well above the national average The Liberal electoral autopsy made clear that the party needed to rebuild its relationship with members of Australia's Chinese community as a priority. In the years since, there's been a noticeable change in tone. Gone are the days of a Liberal leader accusing Labor's deputy Richard Marles of being a Manchurian candidate. ""I'm pro-China,"" Dutton declared when Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Australia last year. Beijing has signalled a remarkable shift in approach towards Canberra, one that appears aimed at bolstering Labor's prospects in the looming federal election. Speaking ahead of this year's election, Liberals think they're in with a chance of winning back the support they lost last time. ""Chinese-Australians are first and foremost Australians,"" Wolahan said. ""The concerns that matter to other people nationally matter to them too — cost of living and the economy."" But the recent visit by a Chinese naval flotilla risks complicating the situation. Shadow Defence Minister Andrew Hastie has repeatedly dubbed the flotilla ""gunboat diplomacy"", a reference to 19th century western imperialism. Andrew Hastie insists his rhetoric on the Chinese government won't hurt Liberal chances in electorates like Keith Wolahan's. (AAP: Mick Tsikas) Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong told Senate estimates this week the Coalition was using inflammatory language to play reckless political games ahead of the election. Hastie dismisses any suggestions that his comments could cost his party votes. ""I think Australians who have a Chinese background are well informed, mature voters,"" he told the ABC. ""To treat them somehow as if they have an allegiance to mainland China is insulting to Chinese-Australians."" Federally, Wolahan has been one of the leading politicians who jumped onto the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu. More commonly known as Rednote or Little Red Book, the app is seen as a Chinese version of Instagram. Keith Wolahan represents the electorate with the most Chinese-Australian voters. (ABC News: David Sciasci) Wolahan quickly gained thousands of followers since joining last year, a trend other MPs with high Chinese-Australian populations in their electorates have followed. ""First-generation migrants typically get news from own language publications and social media,"" Wolahan said. He noticed immediate engagement and found it was a beneficial way to communicate with members of Australia's Chinese communities. Of Red's 150 million active users, almost 700,000 are based in Australia. That presents both opportunities and risks for Australian politicians. It's a sentiment echoed by fellow first-term MP, Labor's Sam Lim, the former dolphin trainer who defeated Liberal frontbencher Ben Morton in his WA electorate. Lim described using Rednote as a way to serve his electorate, to keep people informed about issues ""that wouldn't normally be able to be reached through mainstream media"". ""I get regular positive feedback from Chinese Australians about my posts as they appreciate receiving information about what our government is doing in a way they understand,"" he said. Fan Yang, from the Melbourne University law school, closely monitors the role Chinese social media is playing within Australian politics. She works with a team that monitors three different platforms, WeChat, YouTube and Rednote, to track mis- and disinformation, campaign messaging and communication. While political advertising is banned on Chinese social media platforms, she said Rednote's algorithm allowed politicians to target their messages towards users within geographical areas. But rarely is the content hyper-partisan. Fan Yang studies Australian politicians' use of Chinese social media platforms.  (Supplied) ""Australian politicians on the Little Red Book, they rarely talk about Australia-China relations,"" Dr Yang said. ""They will go out and celebrate the Lunar New Year, they will engage with Chinese migrant communities, they will sometimes participate in communal events, but barely would they talk about Chinese-Australia relations."" Dr Yang pointed to the recent Chinese military flotilla off Australia's east coast as an example of an issue politicians avoided on Rednote. ""I barely see any politicians discuss it,"" she said. The election has not been called yet but the battle for votes on social media is already well underway. So which party is ahead? Even if they were posting about it, it's unlikely it would have gone very far, with politicians' accounts being shadowbanned in recently. While existing followers can still see the MPs' accounts, new users appear unable to find them. It's meant engagement and follower growth has stalled for politicians across the political spectrum on the platform. Wolahan is disappointed in the restrictions but circumspect on the consequences. ""It's not just posting,"" Wolahan said. ""It is also about showing up (in the community) and we have been making an effort to show up.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-02/federal-election-chinese-australian-voters/104950416
Albanese's hesitancy won't help his chances of a long-term Labor legacy,Anthony Albanese might be wary of voter backlash but there's a cost to doing nothing,2025-03-02 04:00:00,"Labor luminary and economic reform maestro Paul Keating once berated the Coalition for squandering its long post-war run in office under Robert Menzies. An era, Keating taunted, when conservatives injected Australia with a ""near-lethal dose of fogeyism"". ""When they put the country into neutral and where we very gently ground to a halt in the nowhere land of the early 1980s, with a dependency on commodities that would not pay for our imports"". History doesn't repeat but there are plenty of echoes. Australia is a nation adrift, confronted by staggering global, intergenerational, welfare, security, energy and climate challenges, seemingly unsure which way to jump. There's little sense of policy ambition. Not much passes the test of real reform. Much is tinkering at the edges, usually by spending more money. There were no shortage of ministers falling over themselves to get in front of cameras and microphones, eager to point out the list of questions they had for would-be prime minister Peter Dutton.  A nation with European appetites for spending, wedded to an American-style aversion to raising revenue. At least a quarter century has passed since the last meaningful tax system change, with John Howard's GST. Across those years there were multiple attempts to address how revenue is raised and impose lasting budget discipline. But almost all collapsed under the weight of special interest campaigns and short-term political opportunism. China's hunger for resources has filled the fiscal cracks. Ken Henry, the former Treasury secretary, characterised this month what is being hoisted onto younger generations as an insidious mix of ""reckless indifference"" and ""wilful acts of bastardry"". Voters will shortly face a choice between two sides of politics pursuing small target strategies wrapped in rhetorical bromides, mired by political meekness. Anthony Albanese responds to Donald Trump's comments on AUKUS As in the 1980s, Australia remains dependent on exports for its wealth and economic wellbeing, even as the shadows of a new global trade war threaten the snug notion that the last four decades of economic expansion will continue unabated. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is yet to put any real meat on the bones of his plan for the nation beyond a taxpayer-funded nuclear program that will not — as MPs on his own side have pointed out — do anything to bring down electricity bills any time soon. Federal Labor and the Coalition both want to expand the bulk-billing incentive to all Australians, to make nine out of 10 GP visits free by the end of the decade. There is currently barely an economic policy or reform on the table that would rouse even the slightest flicker of interest from the likes of Keating, Howard or Peter Costello. So far the Coalition has promised to cut spending by sacking bureaucrats, provide a tax break for business catering, and clear ""roadblocks"" to housing by funding utilities, something that is arguably better handled by the states. If Dutton wins on his current platform, his mandate for action will be limited. At the same time, costs for defence and an aging population mean spending is only going in one direction, underpinned by a tax system held up by commodity prices and fiscal drag. A feature that — as Henry puts it — ""robs"" young workers by forcing them to ""pay higher and higher average tax rates, even if their real incomes are falling"". Tensions rising on the Coalition’s climate policy (Laura Tingle) The federal budget forecasts a future of structural deficits and mounting debt interest costs, yet both sides of politics continue to lure voters with spending promises on the credit card without identifiable spending cuts or tax hikes. Last week's Medicare bulk-billing expansion — Labor's $8.5 billion promise (over four years) was immediately matched by a $9 billion Coalition plan — is just the latest example of what passes for ""reform"" in 2025. The current crossbench is making no promises to guarantee support to either Labor or Coalition in a hung parliament — with nearly all saying they would force a minority government to deal with them bill by bill, and retain their right to withdraw support.  On the other side of the political aisle, pollsters tell us that Labor is dangerously adrift, steaming, on a good day, towards the rocky shoals of minority government. The party's worst case is a historically humiliating loss to Dutton after just one term, something that has happened only once since Federation and not since the Great Depression. Labor insiders acknowledge the threat even as they feel helpless about how to respond. This week the government's focus was on character attacks against Dutton. Labor portrayed the opposition leader as an opportunist share-trader taking advantage of the global financial crisis. He may have questions to answer, but the timing of these attacks only deepen voter cynicism. It also suggests a prime minister with little else to fight on. Ever since he spent what political capital he had on the collapsed Voice campaign, polls and surveys indicate voters regard him with indifference. Liberal and Labor pollsters alike report that Albanese's vote is ""soft"". Which is jargon for a candidate that has lost the public's support but is not actively loathed or hated by voters. What it means is that Dutton does not have the looming election in the bag. Many voters are yet to make up their mind. Peter Dutton’s financial dealings under the spotlight (Laura Tingle) Albanese has made a virtue of winning the Labor leadership from the wreckage of a 2019 defeat to Scott Morrison with a singular promise; that he would win successive terms to bed down long-term Labor goals. History, he suggests, shows that lasting reform, such as Bob Hawke's introduction of Medicare, requires ongoing Labor governments. That ensures changes become embedded in the community and too popular for the other side to unpick. The chaos of the last Labor government gave Tony Abbott a mandate to dismantle Julia Gillard's carbon tax and mining tax. Yet the irony is that Albanese's overwhelming desire to avoid the failures of those years appears to have driven an excess of caution. The prime minister's Overton window is the size of a porthole. The paradox of Albanese's policy conservatism is that he's left Dutton with very little to unwind should the Coalition win. Former National Party leader and deputy prime minister Tim Fischer used to say that the second term is the sweet spot for governments under the Westminster system. It's when big things can happen. But that requires using the first term to build an agenda that voters embrace and endorse. On track for oblivion in his first term, Howard took up the GST ahead of the 1998 election to save himself. It worked. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     There was a telling moment from the PM on Wednesday that points to why so many people say they are disillusioned. Asked by the Herald-Sun at the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Melbourne about the need to adopt a ""bold approach"" and overhaul the tax system across state and federal governments, Albanese responded that ""tax reform is really hard"". He then lamented last year's attempt to revisit Bill Shorten's 2019 promise to limit negative gearing on investment properties. The initiative was revealed by newspapers in September, triggering a week of fevered speculation before being ruled out. ""If you have Treasury, which are supposed to come up with ideas and analysis, have someone looking at something somewhere that Jim Chalmers or I or Katie Gallagher will never meet and know nothing about, people lose their mind,"" he said.  ""It becomes a page one, will-you-rule-in rule-out business. And that makes it really tough."" It's an extraordinary response and one that mirrors what he says privately. The reason we're not doing tax reform, it implies, is not because it's wrong or might harm the nation. It's because it may cause a media storm. And some voters will need a lot of convincing. The idea that people don't want big change ignores the cost of doing nothing. Labor has a positive record from its first term, including aged care and NDIS changes, as well as bedding down the first carbon emissions policy in more than a decade. But negative gearing and capital gains discount reform might have been Albanese's GST. It would have set up a fight against the Coalition on an issue close to the hearts of voters locked out of the property market. Like it did for Howard, it might yet save his skin.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-02/anthony-albanese-small-targets-peter-dutton-hesitancy/104994080
Offshore wind zone project delayed as federal election looms,Illawarra wind zone uncertainty as US renewables company requests delay,2025-02-28 15:38:52,"Federal Labor says it has delayed the assessment of an offshore wind zone project in the NSW Illawarra until after the federal election. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said he had agreed to a request from the US-owned renewables company, BlueFloat, to consider pausing the process. BlueFloat Energy released a brief statement on Friday explaining its request. ""In August 2024, BlueFloat Energy lodged an application for a feasibility licence in the Illawarra offshore wind area of New South Wales,"" the statement read. ""The application is still under assessment, however BlueFloat has requested the Commonwealth government consider not offering any licences in the Illawarra zone until after the upcoming federal election."" The wind farm would cover an area about 80km long. (Supplied: Federal government) Mr Bowen said BlueFloat had raised concerns with him about investing in the project without bipartisan support. ""The Illawarra applicant, which … already has to overcome certain obstacles in deep floating water, they have been concerned by the politics that are being created by Peter Dutton and Ted O'Brien,"" he said. Mr Bowen said he believed the request was reasonable. ""If they get a licence, they then need to proceed to the next stage, which involves spending their money on further feasibility work, further consultations, and they say, 'If we are going to spend the money we need a bit of certainty'."" When approached by the ABC, BlueFloat did not elaborate on the reasons for its decision to ask for a delay. Mr Bowen confirmed BlueFloat Energy was the only proponent that had expressed interest in the Illawarra zone and that the proposal involved ""a small proportion of the entire zone"". Public consultation on the zone began in August 2023.  Originally spanning 1,461 square kilometres, the proposed zone was reduced to 1,022 square kilometres when the federal government declared it in June 2024, covering an area between Stanwell Park and Kiama. The federal government released a visualisation of what the farm would look like from Bulli Lookout. (Supplied: Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water) The Coalition candidates for the Illawarra and South Coast seats of Cunningham, Whitlam and Gilmore have focused their opposition to the project during their early campaigns. During a visit to Gilmore in June, Opposition leader Peter Dutton told a media conference it was ""clear that the project shouldn't go ahead"". Last week, Nationals leader David Littleproud was surrounded by residents opposed to the project when he launched his party's candidate. Mr Bowen said the decision would not turn election battles in the Illawarra and on the South Coast into one-issue campaigns. He said he understood communities had different views on the matter. ""There are people strongly in favour of the Illawarra wind zone, there are people strongly against that,"" he said. The Nationals said the delay was major win for Illawarra residents. In a statement, Mr Littleproud said The Nationals had ""fought tirelessly against Labor's bad idea and it was clear the local Illawarra community didn't want it"".

Pilots of expanding Seahawk fleet 'absolutely' prepared to target hostile submarines,Seahawk helicopter deal inked as pilots back submarine-hunting capabilities,2025-02-28 13:44:29,"Royal Australian Navy pilots flying Australia's growing fleet of submarine-hunting helicopters say they are prepared to target underwater threats.  The federal government on Friday confirmed it had signed a $313.5 million defence contract to service its expanding fleet of Seahawk helicopters at the HMAS Albatross base. The navy maintains 23 MH-60R Seahawk Romeo at HMAS Albatross at Nowra, on the New South Wales south cost, and it plans to add another 13 aircraft by next year. The aircraft are equipped with special radar and sonar devices and anti-submarine torpedoes. Royal Australian Navy pilot Lieutenant Joshua Ryan Callan said the Seahawk crew received specialist training and was capable to targeting hostile submarines. ""The Seahawk Romeo is absolutely capable of conducting submarine warfare,"" he said. Navy pilot Joshua Ryan Callan has carried out live fire exercises using the Seahawk helicopters.  (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez) The government's announcement of the Seahawk contract comes a week after China carried out live fire exercises in international waters off the coast of Australia.  Fellow Seahawk pilot Lieutenant Michael Conway said he was not concerned about the exercises. ""They are not inside Australia's territorial waters, that is a thing that happens routinely,"" he said. ""We rehearse our weapons systems every now and then so I've done a live hellfire shoot in this airframe against what we call 'killer tomato' targets."" Minister for Defence Industry Pat Conroy, who travelled to Nowra for the announcement, said the federal government was monitoring the Chinese ships. ""What matters is that people abide by the international laws and international standards,"" he said. ""We have been very clear that the way the Chinese conducted their live firing exercise in terms of how much notice they gave was unreasonable."" Mr Conroy made the funding announcement alongside Fiona Phillips, the member for the ultra marginal seat of Gilmore. Minister Pat Conroy makes the funding announcement alongside MP, Fiona Phillips who is fighting to hold onto her seat. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez) The prime minister and opposition leader have made multiple trips to Gilmore, which Labor won by just 373 votes at the last election. The latest funding will pay for the servicing of the Seahawk fleet for the next three years, which is expected to create 75 jobs and 20 apprenticeships. Mr Conroy said it would also support 200 existing defence jobs at the naval base. ""This partnership demonstrates the strength of our local expertise and the vital role industry play in supporting our national security,"" he said.

The money will be used to pay for the workers who will maintain the aircraft, which each cost about $15 million. The federal government has already provided $120 million to resurface the tarmac at Albatross to prepare for the arrival of the Seahawk fleet. Seahawk helicopters are typically used for a range of purposes, including cargo and passenger transfer and search and rescue missions. The aircraft stationed at HMAS Albatross are dubbed ""submarine killers"" and are specifically designed for underwater warfare. The contract will pay for the maintenance of the Seahawk helicopters based at HMAS Albatross. (Supplied: Australian Defence Force) The deal also included arrangements to support US aircraft in Nowra. The contract contains an option to maintain, service or overhaul US navy aircraft at HMAS Albatross. US Seahawk helicopters have already been serviced in Nowra and it is expected that number will grow over the coming years. The ABC understands the US will pay for any service costs. The federal government also confirmed it had extended an arrangement to accommodate the Rural Fire Service's (RFS) firefighting fleet at military bases.

Your Say: Voters in Tasmania's most marginal electorates share what they care about,"The election issues that matter to voters in Lyons, Tasmania's most marginal electorate",2025-02-28 07:10:27,"Spanning across almost half of Tasmania, Lyons is Tasmania's most marginal electorate. It's held by Labor by 0.9 per cent, the sixth-smallest margin in the country. Tasmania has five electorates, with Lyons the largest by land mass. (ABC News) Voters from across Tasmania are being encouraged to voice their concerns leading up to the latest federal election in the ABC's Your Say campaign.  The ABC asked voters in Longford what issues mattered to them, and what they wanted politicians to focus on. Health came up a lot, including with local Dee Alty. ""We have a very good health clinic here but when you want to go into the hospital, it's limited [as to] what's available and you have to wait a long time for operations and things like that,"" she said. Dee Alty says health is a key issue for her this upcoming election. (ABC News: Morgan Timms) It was also the number one topic for Barb Baker, who has successfully campaigned for a hospice to be built in Launceston. ""Health is very important to me. We're a sicker, aging population so therefore we do need more resources,"" Ms Baker said. Lynne Jennings wants extra funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. ""It's not good enough, a lot of people losing their funding. If your child or someone in your family has to go through the bureaucrats every year after year, things need to be changed,"" she said.

"China credits Labor, not the Coalition, with 'digging the well'",China favours Labor over the Coalition in the next election. Here's how we know,2025-02-28 05:02:14,"When Foreign Minister Penny Wong concluded her meeting with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the G20 in South Africa last week, insiders were quick to note a striking development: the Chinese side arrived without a list of demands. For years, every bilateral meeting between Canberra and Beijing carried the Chinese Communist Party's well-known grievances: trade restrictions, Huawei bans, or AUKUS defence agreements. Yet this time, there was silence. Far from an oversight, this ""empty list"" was designed to speak volumes. And it did. Beijing signalled a remarkable shift in approach towards Canberra, one that appears aimed at bolstering Labor's prospects in the looming federal election. Penny Wong challenges Chinese foreign minister over 'unprecedented' live fire drills | ABC News Anyone familiar with China's well-rehearsed diplomatic style knows it is anything but ad hoc. Beijing keeps a meticulous record of diplomatic scripts: who welcomes whom, when they arrive, how late they might be, and even which official stands where for the group photo. What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say. Everything — from the handshake grip to whether a smile is appropriate to who speaks first — is carefully choreographed. The reason?  Symbolism is everything in Chinese diplomacy. Each minute detail sends an unspoken message of either respect or disregard. When Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met in South America four months ago, the warmth in his greeting stood in stark contrast to his demeanour with other world leaders at the same event. Some diplomats at the scene, for example, found Xi notably colder just moments before the Australian delegation walked into the same venue. For Australia, the message is that Xi and his administration perceive Labor as the ""well-digger"". The reference goes back to Gough Whitlam's establishment of diplomatic ties with China, hailed by Xi himself as the start of a respectful relationship that has brought both nations together. Anthony Albanese and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the G20 summit. (Supplied: Prime Minister's Office) At a bilateral meeting with Albanese in Beijing in 2023, Xi famously invoked the proverb ""when drinking water, one should not forget those who dug the well"". Labor is credited with that legacy, and Beijing has not hesitated to highlight it. Another crucial element in this evolving dynamic is the engagement between Wong and Wang. Wang once passed along birthday wishes to Wong in person — an exceedingly rare personal touch from Chinese officials. (Supplied: Foreign Ministry of China/File) The latest encounter was the eighth time the two foreign ministers have met since 2022, when the newly elected Albanese government made the first steps to stabilise what had become a rocky relationship during the previous Coalition government. Each subsequent meeting chipped away at the issues that once hindered bilateral ties. Tariffs on Australian exports like barley and wine were quietly lifted. Ministerial dialogue — frozen for years — was revived. Even travel restrictions on Australian tourists and business groups began to soften. However, the hallmark of every negotiation had been China's explicit wish list, signposted to Australia's negotiators. Since taking office as foreign affairs minister, Wong has demonstrated an ability to hold her ground on contentious issues with Beijing while maintaining an open channel for dialogue. Foreign Minister Penny Wong presses China to be more transparent about the actions of its warships off Australia's east coast after they issued a live fire drill warning at short notice on Friday. It is unprecedented that Wang once passed along birthday wishes to Wong in person — an exceedingly rare personal touch from Chinese officials. It points to a remarkable thaw in relations. Under the Morrison and Turnbull governments, high-level dialogue was often brushed aside or refused entirely, and it was widely reported that official phone calls went unanswered during the Coalition era. Watching this reversal under Wong's stewardship suggests a willingness on Beijing's part to reset ties with a Labor face at the table. It is no secret that under the Coalition government, Beijing wielded an array of economic and diplomatic ""sticks"". Australian exports were hit with punitive tariffs, high-level dialogues vanished, and Chinese state-owned media unleashed a barrage of criticism at any perceived slight. Under the Labor government, however, the approach has flipped to ""carrots"" by Beijing's top decision-makers. With Albanese's success in the last election, Beijing eased trade restrictions, opened doors to ministerial talks, and engaged in warm diplomatic gestures. Some interpret this shift as Beijing trying to engineer an Australian government more amenable to Chinese interests. Observers also point to China's broader rivalry with the United States — Australia's key security ally — and see in Labor a better bet for pragmatic balance. Labor's stance on issues like AUKUS remains firm, but the party's diplomatic style differs markedly from that of the previous administration. While no one claims that Labor blindly aligns with Beijing, the tone of discussions — at least on the surface — has been considerably more cordial. However, not all Beijing's actions are beneficial to Labor.  The timing of China's recent naval manoeuvres has not gone unnoticed. China's recent live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea represent the farthest south a Chinese naval group has ever ventured in the region. While some observers initially saw the timing as an attempt to underscore Australia's strategic balancing act ahead of the federal election, many China watchers believe the visit by the head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo — who was in Sydney around the same time — also played a role in this episode. Paparo oversees the United States' preparations for any potential conflict with China and is regularly criticised by Beijing for his comments on the People's Liberation Army's presence in the South China Sea. China holds live fire exercises off Australia’s east coast. (Tom Hartley) Beijing often stages displays of military strength to coincide with visits by senior US officials, underscoring its ability to project power into the South Pacific. From a strictly legal standpoint, there was no violation of international law, as the warships exited Australia's exclusive economic zone before opening fire. However, the underlying message remains: Beijing is normalising its naval presence in these waters and testing the responses of the US and its allies. In this light, the exercises seem less about influencing the Australian electorate and more about sending a signal to Washington — though they do inevitably raise questions about the broader Australia-China relationship. For its part, the Albanese government has responded in kind with minimal fuss. Officials noted their wish for more advanced warning to ensure commercial flights were not disrupted. They also reiterated Australia's commitment to freedom of navigation under UNCLOS. There was little by way of outrage or condemnation, reflecting a carefully calibrated stance. Defence Minister Richard Marles has once again stressed that China did not breach international law by conducting live-fire drills off the coast of Australia, after the Coalition slammed the government's response to the episode. More strident criticism could, after all, jeopardise ongoing conversations or other improvements in bilateral ties. Meanwhile, the US has maintained relative silence, likely out of caution to avoid appearing to hold a double standard regarding its own presence in the South China Sea, a highly contested region of territorial dispute. Both Labor and the Coalition also benefit from avoiding escalation.  There is, however, an undercurrent of concern that miscommunication or miscalculation at sea could lead to dangerous incidents — something Penny Wong reportedly raised with Wang Yi during their talks. Yet questions remain about how far Beijing might go to encourage a Labor victory.  Security agencies continue to warn of coordinated foreign influence efforts, including cyber intrusions and strategic disinformation. Meanwhile, the Coalition has been adjusting its stance on China. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton appeared to have moderated his tone compared to his earlier, more hawkish statements.  For instance, where he once warned Australians to ""prepare for war"" with Beijing, he has emphasised to Chinese Premier Li Qiang that he was willing to maintain open channels of communication and promote the continuous deepening of relations between the two countries. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's tone on China has shifted since last election. (AAP: Russell Freeman) This shift reflects the growing impression that the Coalition wants to project a balanced but firm approach to China.  Some analysts argue that, while both Dutton and Albanese aim to protect Australia's core interests, they employ different strategies: Dutton foregrounds security concerns, while Albanese has focused on diplomatic restoration. Whether this recalibrated stance represents a genuine shift or a tactical move remains unclear, but it underscores the Coalition's attempt to frame itself as both tough on China and responsive to evolving diplomatic realities. Wang's ""empty list"" of demands might seem like a small detail, but in the world of diplomacy, it could be the most telling sign of all. Whether this strategy will sway voters remains uncertain, but Beijing is clearly betting that a continued Labor government is the best route to maintain a cooperative relationship with one of America's key allies in the Indo-Pacific.

Voters were convinced by our AI robocall about the election. It cost $100,We cloned senator Jacqui Lambie's voice with AI to show you what a deepfake election could look like,2025-02-28 10:20:56,"Senator Jacqui Lambie listens intently as a robocall is played from a computer in front of her. ""G'day Tasmanians, it's senator Jacqui Lambie here.  ""As the federal election gets closer, let's get serious. I want to make a pledge to the people of Tasmania, that if re-elected, I will fight tooth and nail to move the national capital from Canberra to Tassie, where it bloody well belongs."" What Senator Lambie just heard was a clone of her voice, produced by ABC NEWS Verify with her permission, to demonstrate the danger of the technology as the election nears. The senator erupts in raucous laughter. ""You don't need to give me a fake one for that! I could have just said it myself!"" she jokes. Jacqui Lambie reacts her to the AI-generated voice clone. (ABC News) Realising the gravity of the technology, Senator Lambie's mood turns sombre. ""It's scary. It's really scary that they're this close to sounding like Jacqui Lambie,"" she says. Although the senator had expected the clone to be even more convincing, she conceded it wasn't far off. ""It's only going to be a matter of months — I'd say months — before they have it exact."" So, would the voters in her state know the difference? Burnie, on Tasmania's north-west coast, is Jacqui Lambie territory. Outside the senator's electoral office, we encountered a woman on her way out of the gym. ""I believe her, I've always liked Jacqui Lambie and seen her throughout the years and been a local and all that. But I stand by her,"" she said, after hearing the voice clone's pitch. We play AI-generated Lambie to the constituents of Burnie, Tasmania. Will they be fooled? (ABC News) Similar reactions came from residents and tourists alike, indicating support for Robo-Lambie's pitch. ""Really?"" responded the young gym goer when the ruse was revealed. ""AI-generated really fools us all,"" she said. Others weren't so easily convinced. ""It's a spoof of some sort. She's not actually going to move all that infrastructure and put the cost on the taxpayer,"" one tradie replied. It was the information in the recording, he claimed, that alerted him to the fake. ""The facts will be how you navigate the AI. The context, not the words, not the voices"". Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. But others told us they sensed something wasn't quite right in the voice itself. Of the 18 people who listened to the recording, 12 admitted that they did not know they were listening to an AI voice clone of the senator. There's been a lot of reporting on the dangers of video deepfakes — machine-generated video designed to fool audiences. The ABC even made one of Greens senator David Shoebridge earlier this year, to demonstrate how far the technology had come. But audio deepfakes can be a bigger risk as there are fewer clues for the listener. And fake audio can strike not only over the internet, but over the phone, where there is less context for listeners to rely on. There are instances where deepfaked audio has been created to influence voters in other countries, but the evidence of their impact is hard to measure. The ABC commissioned this deepfake video of Greens senator David Shoebridge with his permission. In Slovakia in 2023, a well-timed deepfake of parliamentary candidate Michal Šimečka, discussing electoral fraud with a prominent journalist was released days before the vote. Mr Šimečka's rival, Robert Fico, went on to win the election, but it isn't clear if the deepfake made an impact. And in the United States last year, an apparent voice clone of then-president Joe Biden tried to convince voters not to vote in the New Hampshire primary. Mr Biden went on to win that primary, as well as clinch the nomination for president, before dropping out of the race. Toby Murray, a professor of computing and information systems at the University of Melbourne, told ABC NEWS Verify the ability of the technology to produce a convincing deepfake has accelerated in recent years. ""Five years ago the ability to create a convincing voice clone was certainly out of reach for anyone who was not a machine learning scientist. ""Yet now there are a number of companies that offer really easy to use online tools and the ability for anyone to … create a pretty convincing voice clone."" During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help. ABC NEWS Verify produced the audio using a market-leading platform, which is easily accessed on the internet — the voice clone cost about $100 to make. No technical assistance from an expert was required, and just 90 seconds of audio of the senator, taken from an interview, was needed to help the platform learn. The generator used by ABC NEWS Verify to create the voice clone has a tool which can detect whether audio has been created using the platform. When we uploaded the audio file we created directly from the generator, the tool gave it a 98 per cent probability of being created by the generator. As an experiment, we then played the audio file aloud on a computer, recording the sound with an iPhone. When that iPhone audio file was loaded into the tool, the tool gave it only a 2 per cent chance of being created by the platform. ABC NEWS Verify's top tips for spotting AI-generated ""people"" in the wild. (ABC News) The distortion created by the external recording was enough to fool the software, demonstrating the imperfection of technical solutions to detecting fake audio. Professor Murray said that not only is the technology now easy to use, it can also be difficult to detect. ""We should absolutely expect the detection technology will get better, but we should also expect that it's never going to be perfect,"" he said. He noted that there would always be an arms race between the detection software and the AI audio generators themselves. Last year, a Senate select committee inquiry into the use of AI recommended the government ""introduce new, whole-of-economy, dedicated legislation to regulate high-risk uses of AI"". But like truth in political advertising laws, the government has not yet acted. The outcome of two misleading assertions in 2022 reinforces what many in Australia have long suspected — that when it comes to the facts, there is one set of rules for politicians and another for everyone else. Senator Lambie says that's not good enough, and that older Australians were particularly vulnerable to scams using the technology. ""Something needs to be done today. And instead [the government] is worrying about their seats… instead of worrying about the welfare of the people in this country,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Department of Industry, Science and Resources told ABC NEWS Verify the government is ""considering proposed mandatory guardrails for AI in high-risk settings"". ""Consultation on these proposed regulations closed late last year, and the government is now considering the feedback received,"" they said.  ""A final approach will be announced in due course"". There are steps you can take to prevent being fooled by fake audio, Professor Murray said, that don't rely on imperfect technology. ""The basic advice [is] trying to remain sceptical, trying to be aware of when you're being manipulated and where outrage is being used against you,"" he said. ""Just in the same way when you see an ad on Facebook or a post on Facebook that's making very outrageous claims, your degree of outrage should be some warning to you that what you're seeing is perhaps not 100 per cent true. ""And the same is true when you're hearing someone's voice … If the claims being made are outrageous, that's probably a pretty good tip-off that perhaps what you're hearing is not legitimate."" Artificially generated images, video and audio have flooded the internet in recent years. Take our quiz to see if you can tell real from fake. A spokesman for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) told ABC NEWS Verify robocalls should be authorised, just like other electoral advertisements. The absence of an authorisation could be a flag that the robocall was fake, and should be reported to the AEC. If there is an authorisation, and you still suspect the audio was faked, members of the public can make a complaint on the AEC's website. ""The use of deepfake technology for the 2025 federal election is not illegal and, in many cases, is not likely to be used in an unethical manner,"" the spokesman said. ""The AEC is also not aware of any evidence that the use of AI in electoral communication has been the determining factor in election results for the more than 60 national elections held around the world in 2024.""

Strong Labor city faces independent challenge in federal election,"As a federal election looms, these are the issues and seats to watch in Canberra",2025-02-27 05:31:14,"When election observers ask where a federal poll will be won and lost, the ACT rarely rates a mention. But since independent senator David Pocock broke through for an historic victory in 2022, the capital has attracted more attention. His success was repeated, albeit at a smaller scale, in the ACT election last year, which suggests the appetite for a political alternative has not been quenched in Canberra. Even so, it will take a lot to dislodge Labor MPs in one of the strongest Labor cities in the country. The ABC asked Canberrans what issues matter to them ahead of this year's election. Even before the campaign proper has begun, Canberra has featured prominently in the opposition's plan to reduce government spending. Peter Dutton has flagged axing as many as 36,000 public servants, roughly equivalent to the number of extra staff Labor has hired in its first term. Fewer than 40 per cent of the new recruits actually work in Canberra, and there is some ambiguity about how many Canberra-based staff could be cut, and whether the roles would be outsourced. But it would not be the first time a newly-minted Liberal prime minister took an axe to the service; John Howard began his first term in 1996 by slashing the number of public servants, which triggered a downturn for the local economy. Anthony Albanese unveiled a boost to Medicare funding at a rally in Tasmania on Sunday.  (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough) As for Labor's agenda, its recently announced boost to Medicare attracted significant attention in a jurisdiction saddled with the lowest bulk billing rates in the country. Against the backdrop of a ballooning health budget at the territory level, efforts to strengthen primary care may ease another Labor government's headache, if they are successful. But Labor's first-term efforts only saw a marginal increase in bulk billing rates in Canberra, and local health figures have cast doubt on just how many more Canberrans could expect to see a doctor for free under these changes. While Senate races are often an afterthought, in the ACT it is by far the most compelling electoral contest. Labor got a third of the vote — a full quota — in 2022, ahead of the Liberals just shy of 25 per cent, and David Pocock on 21 per cent. But even from third, the former Wallaby received enough preferences — largely from the Greens and another prominent independent — to defeat Liberal minister Zed Seselja for the second seat. Now running for re-election, the consensus is that Senator Pocock's vote is likely to increase — although he is less bullish about his prospects. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher could be under pressure if Senator Pocock draws more votes than her. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) If he draws more votes from Labor, it could put Finance Minister Katy Gallgher in the danger zone. But the Liberals' effort to reclaim a seat has been complicated by a preselection bungle. The party called a special meeting to consider dumping its lead candidate Jacob Vadakkedathu over branch-stacking concerns — which he has denied — but simply confirmed the original result. Member for Bean David Smith's primary vote in 2022 was the lowest of all three of Canberra's Labor MPs at 42 per cent. (ABC News: Marco Catalano) The southernmost of the three ACT electorates, Bean, is presenting one of the least predictable contests this time around. Labor's David Smith holds the seat covering Tuggeranong, Weston Creek, most of Woden, and the Molonglo Valley, by almost 13 per cent. But this is the one seat in the ACT where a 'Voices of' group has activated a campaign behind an independent candidate, midwife Jessie Price. The last election showed an independent can be successful if they can bring an incumbent's primary down below 40 per cent, get their own vote up to around 30, and attract enough preferences. David Smith's primary vote in 2022 was the lowest of all three Labor MPs at 42 per cent. But this is also the part of Canberra the Liberals have typically done best in, and if the party's vote recovers, it may help keep this as a traditional two-party contest, albeit a closer one. Elsewhere, the Greens will once again target Labor's Alicia Payne in Canberra, after the party broke through and finished second in 2022. The most senior of the ACT's three lower house MPs, Andrew Leigh, is one of only two declared candidates in the northern seat of Fenner, and is not expected to face a substantial challenge. Yet, as the political consensus breaks across the country, often serving up unexpected results as it did in 2022, not even the ACT is immune to surprises. Member for Fenner Andrew Leigh is not expected to face a substantial challenge for his seat. (Matt Roberts)",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-27/act-senate-house-federal-election/104985628

He laments a lack of leadership in government. Politicians, as far as he's concerned, should focus more on the people and less on themselves. ""None of the politicians today actually want to sit down and have a chat,"" the 64-year-old semi-retired Tasmanian says. Mr Horton lives in the electorate of Lyons, which stretches from the state's north-west through the Central Highlands to the south-east tip of the island. It is a mixture of socio-economic groupings and demographics. Mr Horton says the three most important focus areas for him in the 2025 federal election are cost of living, energy and healthcare. Jason Horton says cost of living, energy policy and healthcare are his priorities ahead of the election.  (ABC News: Morgan Timms/Dylan Goolagong) Across the country, as the pseudo-campaign ramps up ahead of a poll date, Mr Horton's concerns are echoed by voters in safe and marginal seats alike. The ABC today launches the Your Say project, part of the Australia Votes: Your Vote, Your Say election coverage, to give all Australian voters a voice on what matters to them most this federal election. In its February 2025 Mood of the Nation survey, research firm SECNewgate Australia found 81 per cent of Australians reported management of cost of living was the number one issue to influence their vote. Housing, health care, crime and economic management were also at the top of the list. University student Meg Southcombe lives in the ALP seat of Newcastle in New South Wales. Like many of her colleagues, she works several jobs, on top of her full-time university studies, just to make ends meet. ""We are really ringing the cloth dry,"" the 21-year-old says.

""You want someone in power who listens to people and tries to make decisions with the community voice coming through."" The federal election is due on or before May 17. The Reserve Bank's recent decision to cut interest rates has heightened expectation it will be called soon. Both major parties have already well and truly left the campaign starter's block. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a Labor pledge to spend $8.5 billion over four years on health care, promising nine out of 10 GP visits will be free from out-of-pocket expenses by 2030. The Coalition has vowed to match it dollar-for-dollar. Major party leaders have already begun pseudo-campaigning ahead of the election date being set. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) In Lyons, Jason Horton says it disturbs him that Tasmania fails to win equal federal health funding compared with other states. Lyons is held by the ALP with a margin of 0.9 per cent and the current Labor MP is retiring. Mr Horton questions why Tasmanians should have to fly to the mainland for surgery and treatment. ""We should actually get it in our state because part of your recovery is your support mechanism and, if your family aren't up there with you, then it makes it very hard,"" he explains.

Over in Western Australia, Tangney is the state's most marginal seat, held by the ALP with a margin of 2.8 per cent. At the last election, the ALP picked up the seat with a community-focused campaign. Richard Brown has lived in the electorate for eight years. He wants to hear more from the candidates about energy policies and how they are going to tackle cost-of-living pressures. Mr Brown is not for throwing out gas. ""I think we need it because it's cheap and we have so much of it that other countries don't have … so not to rely too much on renewables policies,"" he says.

Lawyer allegedly assaulted amid battle for Nationals stronghold,Allegations of assault and theft amid federal election battle for seat of Calare,2025-02-27 10:20:56,"Two rivals vying for the New South Wales federal seat of Calare are claiming they have been victims of vandalism as police investigate an alleged assault on a lawyer. Warning: This story contains an image of a Nazi symbol. Federal MP Andrew Gee has claimed a ""well organised"" operation designed to silence his re-election campaign is behind an incident involving Orange-based solicitor Toby Tancred as well as the theft of corflutes and trespassing. Mr Gee's main competitor, Nationals candidate Sam Farraway, has recently been the target of anti-Semitic graffiti and alleges people have been trespassing on private property to destroy his campaign signage. ""It is an unfortunate and unwanted part of the campaign"" Mr Farraway said in a statement. Andrew Gee says his campaign material is being targeted by vandals. (ABC Central West: Toby Hemmings) Mr Gee is seeking re-election as an independent in the Central West after defecting from the Nationals in 2022 over the party's opposition to the Voice to Parliament. He issued a call on social media for CCTV footage and alleged his supporter, Mr Tancred, was assaulted by three young men on Tuesday night. Mr Gee claims the group was stealing corflutes from outside the solicitor's office when he approached them and had to defend himself before the trio fled the scene. ""I think it's disgraceful and reprehensible,"" Mr Gee said. ""Everyone should have the right to put out an election poster in peace without having crimes committed against them."" The MP claims it was not the only incident of posters being stolen in Orange on Tuesday night. ""It shows you how desperate some people are to silence our campaign,"" he said. Andrew Gee is hoping to win Calare for the fourth time. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy) Police say they are investigating reports of an altercation at a business office in Orange on Tuesday night after a man began removing posters from the front of the building. It is part of a larger investigation into the theft of political posters in the Orange, Lucknow and Wellington areas. Mr Gee also said his election posters had been ""systemically"" stolen from properties in Lucknow, Molong, Wellington, Orange, as well as trailers, over the past few weeks. He said many instances involved people trespassing onto private property. ""Almost as soon as we're putting posters out, they're coming down,"" he said. Mr Gee has held the seat of Calare since 2016 and is going into an election without the backing of a major party for the first time. Nazi symbols have been graffitied onto billboards promoting the Sam Farraway.  (Supplied: Office of Sam Farraway) The generally conservative electorate was held by independent Peter Andren from 1996 to 2007. The electorate is considered a Nationals stronghold in western NSW and covers Bathurst, Lithgow, Orange and Mudgee. The 2025 campaign will be a true test of Mr Gee's popularity as a politician and will reveal whether his success was tied to the party. The Nationals candidate for the seat is former NSW Legislative Council member Sam Farraway. He said he resigned from state parliament in November 2024 to give his ""full attention"" to pursuing a win in Calare. In January, a Nationals billboard in Orange featuring Mr Farraway in Orange was found graffitied with Nazi symbols.  ""This campaign should be focused on the issues that matter to voters,"" Mr Farraway said in a statement. This is not the first time Mr Gee has claimed he has been targeted for political purposes. In November 2023, he used parliamentary privilege to announce that a package containing empty wine bottles with an ""insulting message"" was anonymously sent to his home in Orange. Mr Gee told parliament that CCTV footage indicated it was posted by the then-chair of the NSW National Party's federal electorate council, who was asked to resign over the incident.

"'If you think it's biased, it is biased': Albanese and Dutton turn to podcasts ahead of election","'If you think it's biased, it is biased': Albanese and Dutton turn to podcasts ahead of election",2025-02-27 12:47:17,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show, wedding plans and DJ styles aren’t exactly the usual topics for the Australian prime minister in a pre-election interview.  Yet, Anthony Albanese touched on all of them in the first couple of minutes of his 90 minute, wide-ranging podcast interview with content creator Abbie Chatfield.  A month or so earlier, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was talking Mr Potato Head memes on Mark Bouris' podcast and changing nappies on Olympian Sam Fricker's.    Interviews with popular podcasters featured in the 2024 US presidential campaign and now the medium has been embraced by Australian leaders of the major parties as a federal election looms.  But in Australia, it's still not clear if the audio programs will be key avenues to undecided voters, or an echo chamber reinforcing the views of a like-minded audience.  The long-form chats, often cut into catchy snippets on social media, or posted in full on YouTube, attract audiences not always engaged with traditional news media.  Is this a TikTok election? Podcasts are most popular among younger listeners and with men, according to the Triton Digital 2024 Australian Podcast Report. The report found 48 per cent of 18–34-year-olds surveyed had listened to podcasts within the last month, compared to 21 per cent of over 55s.  In the gender split, the report estimated 42 per cent of men listened each month, compared to 33 per cent of women.  Peter Dutton is clearly connecting with disenfranchised young men better than progressives and Anthony Albanese are. The risk is how that translates across the electorate. Before her interview with Albanese, Abbie Chatfield highlighted that she believed most members of her audience were Greens voters and she has previously stated that many of her listeners are women.   Young women are still seen as a key base for the Greens and Labor party.  During the lengthy interview, released last Friday, Albanese made a point about preferential voting and then called on Greens voters to give Labor their second preference over other parties.   While talking on businessman Mark Bouris' Straight Talk podcast the opposition leader made a clear pitch to young male voters.  ""Young males feel disenfranchised and they feel ostracised,"" Dutton said.   ""{They tell me] I’m being told that I'm sort of ogre, or some sort of belief structure that is true to that ... there's a point where people are fed up."" Albanese also appeared on this show several weeks ago, and was happy to chat about football, family and policy.  The digital landscape often feeds this content not to undecided voters, but those who already hold similar views, one digital media expert said.  ""We've seen the advent of social media platforms, and the echo chambers it creates,"" said Dr Raffaele Ciriello, from the University of Sydney.  ""It can often lead to people segregating into communities of like-minded people."" Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Some shows promise powerful reach to key demographics, but the performance of leaders is still key.  Podcasts demand leaders abandon political speak — the talking points and focused party messages — and embrace a more casual and relaxed conversation style.   Humour, personal stories and relatability become key.  In Australia, the Triton rankings often show society and culture, comedy and true crime podcasts attract the largest audience.  Following the US election, Ciriello and Assistant Professor Vitali Mindel conducted research into the influence of podcasts on the presidential race.  The battle for your ears is real. The clamour of conversation is the soundtrack of your life. When I reflect on the podcasts that resonate and land, the real query should be about what actually connects. Their initial findings found Donald Trump’s podcast strategy during the election campaign significantly boosted his support – perhaps by as much as 1 to 2.6 per cent.  Much of this was attributed to his appearance on the popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has an extremely large, mostly male audience.  “For a lot of people ... after seeing Donald Trump on the Joe Rogan experience - that's what got them,"" Ciriello said about his research currently under peer review.   “Joe Rogan and the like have boosted Trump's support among young male voters, whereas if you compare that to Kamala Harris, she relied on more traditional, curated media, like TV debates and appearances.”  Many of the podcasts Trump appeared on weren’t news podcasts but shows with internet personalities with large male audiences while Kamala Harris appeared on several shows, including the popular Call Her Daddy podcast, which has millions of women listeners.  Edison Research found that Trump’s appearance on 20 podcasts, compared to Kamala Harris’ eight shows, secured him an audience reach of more than 23 million people in an average week, compared to Harris’ 6.4 million.   In Australia, podcast reach is significantly smaller, but if it's with the right demographics it could still prove powerful.  Podcasters, who are often media and internet personalities, play by different rules to traditional political reporters, offering interviews that can be friendlier, more conversational and more agreeable.  Chatfield explained her approach to her interview in a more than 5-minute-long preamble at the start of her podcast.  “My primary goal in this is to get the Labor Government back into government,” she said.   “If you think this is biased, it is biased.  “It isn't perfect conversation, just as the Labor Party isn’t the perfect party, but I do prefer Labor to the Liberal Party.”  She did press the prime minister on some topics like carbon emissions, the Gaza conflict and whether Labor will work with the Greens in the future. She said she plans to interview Greens leader Adam Bandt and has requested interviews with Dutton and former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.  ""I'm going 'c'mon Liberal boys',"" she said on her podcast.  In Australia, Dutton so far appears to be replicating Trump’s podcast strategy, with appearances on shows with mostly male audiences. Albanese appears to be trying a different strategy with appeals to young people and woman.  This will all be supplemented by more traditional appearances on TV, radio, print, and self-created social media content.  “I think it would probably be an overreach to say that podcasts alone will decide the election, but I think it's safe to say that they will play a role,” Ciriello said.

Federal parties vie over ocean protection ahead of election,Labor spruiks marine park protection as Coalition pledges industry 'balance',2025-02-26 06:38:18,"Protection of Australia's oceans is shaping up to be a federal election issue for coastal communities as rangers and researchers work to battle illegal fishing, pollution and climate change. The federal Labor government is promoting its expansion of the national marine park network and funding for research, while the Coalition is arguing it will better protect Australian waters from foreign fishing. One research project on the front line is a Charles Darwin University-led initiative in Australia's most northern marine park, Arafura, 250 kilometres north of Darwin. The CDU project in the Arafura Marine Park has been awarded $390,000 in federal funding. (Supplied: Natalie Robson) In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Croker Island's Garngi Indigenous ranger group, the team researches key feeding and migratory routes of turtles, whales and dolphins in the park. ""It's a real hotspot for a whole range of marine species — very small coastal bottlenose dolphins, Bryde's whales, green turtles, hawksbill turtles and humpback whales,"" Charles Darwin University (CDU) marine scientist Carol Palmer said. WWF's Australian marine species program manager Elouise Haskin said research in the area was essential. Elouise Haskin says climate change poses a threat to all species. (ABC News: Nicholas Martyr) ""It's very hard to manage threats if you don't know to what degree the impact is having on various species, so we are helping to fill in those gaps,"" she said. As part of the project the research team is satellite tagging turtles to study where they travel to. Researchers are trying to reduce sand temperatures in turtle nests. (Supplied: Carol Palmer) They are also trialling different turtle nest shades to stop climate warming making the sand too hot and producing more female hatchlings. ""It worries me that they are all turning female because if there's no male turtles, then how are they going to reproduce?"" Garngi Indigenous ranger Sonny Wauchope said. Dr Palmer said the team was also researching a ""worrying"" increase in marine litter and its impact on marine animals' health. Carol Palmer says a lot more survey work is needed in the north's remote marine parks. (ABC News: Jane Bardon) ""Ten years ago I would never have seen the number of microplastics and ghost nets that are now here in the Northern Territory,"" she said. Garngi ranger Tyson Cooper said his group was detecting increasing numbers of illegal Indonesian fishing boats. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority says there has been an ""unprecedented"" influx of foreign boats in the north, with 172 detections in the past six months. ""It's a big worry because it's hard to find them as they hide between those mangroves and up in those rivers,"" Mr Cooper said. Garngi ranger Tyson Cooper is worried about the impact of illegal fishing on marine animals. (Supplied: Natalie Robson) The federal government says funding for this work, and its marine park network expansion, exceeds its international commitment to strongly protect 30 per cent of Australia's waters by 2030. Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said since coming to government, Labor had ""added an area the size of Italy and Germany combined"" to Australia's protected waters. Tanya Plibersek says Labor has increased the area and extent of Australia's marine protection. (ABC News: Toby Hunt) ""Last year we quadrupled the Heard and McDonald Island Marine Reserve and the previous year we tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park."" Some environment groups have disputed that figure because gas and fishing industries still operate in many parks. But Ms Plibersek said it met the international agreement, adding 24 per cent of Australia's oceans were ""highly protected"" and free of fishing or extractive industries. Labor is also proposing to ban all oil and gas extraction from Australia's south-eastern marine parks off Victoria and Tasmania. Researchers say the Arafura Marine Park is a real ""hotspot"" for a range of marine species, including dolphins and turtles. (Supplied) Ms Plibersek accused the Coalition of posing a risk to marine parks because it made big cuts to no-take zones in 2017 when it was in government. The opposition's environment spokesman Jonathan Duniam told the ABC the Coalition was committed to the marine park network. But he is not planning to expand its size or protections if elected, and would improve the management of marine parks by balancing the needs of fishing, tourism and other industries. Jonathan Duniam said the Coalition would do more to stop illegal foreign fishing in the parks. (Supplied) ""I have no plans to unilaterally go and declare areas marine protected,"" he said. ""If a request came in [to protect more marine areas], we would seek to balance all of the interests. Mr Duniam said the Coalition would boost resources to stop illegal foreign fishing in the parks, but did not outline a commitment. ""I won't sign a blank cheque now but it is the sort of thing we do need to take seriously,"" he said. Ms Plibersek said the government was already doing that. The federal government and Border Force say more resources are being devoted to stop illegal boat arrivals off the Northern Territory coast. ""We've been prepared to sink boats and … take the strongest possible action against illegal fishing, and we'll continue to do that,"" she said. Dr Palmer said the stresses on the Arafura Marine Park showed more resources were needed to tackle the many threats to sea life across Australia's northern sea country. ""If we can keep working together with the Commonwealth, the ranger groups and the traditional owners, we could move forward and be able to manage it way, way better,"" she said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-26/how-labor-and-coalition-stand-on-marine-park-protection/104964124

""I think I did have all the skills but the one thing I had that nobody else had — well, I had confidence — but nobody else had the computer skills I had, way back in 1989."" Green made his television debut in 1991, which resulted in a small on-air role on election night. (ABC News) News managers and senior journalists quickly clocked the university graduate's unique abilities and he was offered a permanent position. He went on to design the election night computer program that the ABC still uses to this day (with some tweaks along the way). His first on-air appearance was in the 1991 NSW state election, and his first federal election broadcast was the return of the Keating Labor government in 1993. Antony Green on covering his first federal election for ABC News 2025 will be Green's 11th federal election broadcast for the ABC. Seven of them were anchored by Kerry O'Brien (1993, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2013), three by Leigh Sales (2016, 2019, 2022) and his final one will be hosted by David Speers and Sarah Ferguson. Green will be succeeded by Casey Briggs, already well-known to ABC audiences for his outstanding communication and data skills. Briggs's title will be ABC chief election and data analyst. Leigh Sales has anchored the last three federal election broadcasts alongside Antony Green. (ABC News: Leigh Sales) What has made you decide now is the time to go? In my job, you end up having this three-year cycle of federal elections. By the time of the next election, I'll be 68 and I know I'm not as sharp and quick as I was five years ago. It gets harder and harder. It's like a footballer, sometimes they play on a season too long, and I'm making sure I don't do that. It's a decision I made three years ago. This will be my last one on-camera, but what I will do is stay on for another year or two and I'll try to ensure that the work I've put in — people see me on camera, but most of my work is off-camera, doing websites, background material, setting up computer systems — I'll ensure that whoever replaces me has that material available and knows how to do the systems. I remember when you came off air after the last federal election in 2022, you were absolutely exhausted and said at the time, I think that's my last one. It never shows on air, but I'm not sure if people realise how truly exhausting that job is and the amount of pressure that comes with it. Well, that election was the hardest. When I started this job 35 years ago, every seat was a two-candidate preferred contest, 80-85 per cent of the votes were cast on the day. You just got polling place results and everything worked well in terms of predicting models. The main part of Green's job in preparing for election day is building the database. (ABC News: Robert Estherby) But things have got more complex. The major party vote has declined over the years. More and more people are voting pre-poll, which means they come in later in the evening and they don't always behave like the polling day votes. The whole modelling process has got more difficult. You're starting to see third party candidates come through, like the teals at the last election. We didn't have an obvious model to call some of those seats, so you're having to make a lot more individual decisions. How did you come to work at the ABC? I had worked in the computer industry and it got a bit dull. I couldn't imagine still doing that in 10 years time, let alone 30 or 40 years. I went back to university in 1984 — I had done a science/maths degree the first time through after school — and I did an economics/politics degree. I was inspired by the first years of the Hawke government, all the change that was coming through. After starting out as a researcher and computer programmer, Antony Green has become the face of the ABC's election coverage. It was all economics and I was quite fascinated by it. But at the end of that, I was back writing computer code again and I thought, ""My god, what have I spent four years doing this degree for?"" I told my bosses, I'm leaving, I have to find something else to do. I looked in the newspaper that weekend and there was this ad for an election researcher, you had to have research skills, computer skills, and I went, ""That's me!"" And so I applied and the legendary ABC producer, Ian Carroll, selected me out of about 150 applicants. I think I did have all the skills but the one thing I had that nobody else had — well, I had confidence — but nobody else had the computer skills I had, way back in 1989. So you came in, and they realised, as you say, ""This guy's got a unique skill-set that nobody else has."" When did it shift to you being on-air instead of behind the scenes? It was about two years later. The 1990 federal election went until very late in the evening, and afterwards, [journalists] Kerry O'Brien, Andrew Olle and Paul Lyneham all told the head of news they should re-employ me. So I was given this job to redesign the computer system. About a year and a half later, we used it in Queensland in 1992. It was just terrific, it worked really well. Antony Green was tasked with redesigning the computer system for elections.  (Supplied: Eric Napper) In the meantime, I'd written some software to calculate redistributions and in 1991 there was a major one in New South Wales. The Greiner government cut the size of the parliament by about 10 seats. It had all sorts of political implications and I worked it out. So [journalist] Quentin Dempster put me on camera that night to talk about it. I remember, I was so nervous. We had this map and I had to use a pointer, and my hand was going like that [demonstrates violent shaking] and the director of the broadcast, the late Janie Lalor, came down and said, ""If you lean the pointer on the map, your hand won't shake."" This was my first tip! Green on set for the 2007 federal election night coverage alongside Kerry O'Brien, Julia Gillard and Nick Minchin. (ABC News) I remember bumping into the legendary Paul Williams [former head of ABC News] on the Monday, and he said, ""Mate! MATE! I saw you on camera on the weekend."" I said, ""Oh, I was so nervous."" And he said, ""We could see you were nervous but everyone could tell you knew what you were talking about."" And so I think that was the advantage I had. I was slightly quirky, had a strong accent, stronger than I do now, and everyone went, ""He knows what he's talking about though."" They used me on camera for the first time in 1992 federal election. We had a new computer system. We didn't display the graphics quite right. We predicted quite early that the Keating government was re-elected and there was a bit of a bunfight as to whether we could call that or not. Well that's because it was very unexpected because everyone anticipated Keating was going to lose. So it was quite something when you were on live TV, Keating's going to be re-elected. People didn't believe it. There's a lot of myths that people on the board are running the ABC and they're not, you rarely ever hear from anyone or the managing director. But that night, the MD was David Hill and on the board were John Bannon, the former South Australian premier, and Rod Cameron, who was a Labor Party pollster, and they thought Keating had lost. They were watching our coverage, and it was showing there's a swing to Labor, swing to Labor, swing to Labor. There was a lot of concern from high up, ""Are we getting this right? Stop using those predictions!"" You mentioned when you first started doing it, you'd get horrendously nervous. How about now, do you still get nervous? I get nervous until I see the first figures come in from the Electoral Commission. Antony Green says he gets nervous until he sees the figures from the Electoral Commission. (ABC News: Natasha Johnson) And then it's off and running. You're off and running. Once you've got numbers, you know you've got numbers. I've described election night as like bungee jumping for intellectuals. You've got this thin tether of data that keeps you in touch with the Electoral Commission. I know when I've been anchoring, when the executive producer comes in my ear and says ""Antony is ready to call it"", I start shaking because it feels so big that we're about to call it and the terror strikes about what if we get it wrong. Last election you put me on the spot! I'd done a rather indeterminate call, there'd been a bit of confusion and they rolled the tune, swapping the cameras around and all the trumpets went off, and they came to me, and I said, ""I think they want me to call it, but I'm not ready to call it yet!"" There was a bit of miscommunication. Antony Green reflects on the last federal election working alongside Leigh Sales.  (ABC News: Leigh Sales) But then about 20 minutes later, none of you had understood what I'd said, and you suddenly came to me and said, ""Antony, are you saying Anthony Albanese will be the 30th prime minister?"" And I'm sitting there thinking, ""Oh god Leigh, put me on the spot."" I think as journos, we're trained to want clarity, whereas a data expert is seeing nuance. David Speers did it to me at the last Queensland election as well! David said to me, ""So you're not ruling out that the Miles government could be re-elected?"" I was like, ""Oh god."" We're evil people Antony. Do you feel any pressure to call it first, because obviously the commercials all have their broadcasts on too. Do you feel any weight on you around that? No, I don't think so. There have been two elections where we over-called them. One was 2010 in Victoria and we misread the data. While we were right that the Brumby government was defeated, we called it far too early. The last NSW election we were right, but we over-predicted what Labor would win. Occasionally you get ahead of yourself, but you just have to be cautious. What did your mum and dad think about seeing you on TV when you started out? Oh, I think they were quite chuffed. Dad was an electrician from the north of England and mum was a seamstress. They migrated here, I got a good education here. I've done alright in this country, better than I would have done in Warrington in Lancashire. They were very proud. Dad died 14 years ago of a heart attack and mum died of dementia a couple of years later. I got an Order of Australia a couple of years back, after they died. I think one of the reasons I took the OA is because they would have been so proud of that. Antony Green was in Brisbane for the Queensland election night in 2024. (ABC News: Matt Eaton) What were you like as a kid? Always bright, always good with numbers. Confident? Not particularly. I think I was always a spark when I was a young kid, I was a voracious reader, still am, a notorious devourer of facts. Not always good at putting them into good order and synthesising a general theory. My first couple of years of high school, I don't remember, I think I was very late into puberty. I blossomed a bit later. I know you like cycling, you love cricket. Are you going to have more time for that, or will you keep working, what's the plan? I will continue to work. I will stay involved with the ABC computer set up. I'll keep up the website through to the next South Australian election which is early next year. After that, I'll slowly step away and mainly just be involved in negotiating with the Electoral Commission. Antony, you have been an awesome colleague. I have greatly enjoyed working with you and admired you for 30 years. You've been brilliant. Thank you so much for your service and for being such a trusted figure for the ABC. You're an absolute legend. And it's been fantastic to work with you, and all those many people who came before. Kerry O'Brien, such an important part of me being on camera and staying on camera. He didn't like the touch screen, but that's another story! I've worked with many, many people over the years. Antony Green says ABC stalwart Kerry O'Brien was instrumental to his on camera role with the broadcaster. (ABC News) For me, somebody who didn't have a journalism background, I've had impostor syndrome sometimes — ""Me, what am I doing here?"" But I remember talking to Peter Cave one day, a veteran ABC journalist, famously held up on the highway by some Arabs during the Gulf War, had guns pointed at him and all that. I remember I could talk to Peter about that, and he would treat me as an equal. Because I wasn't a journalist, I was always impressed by those people. They were impressed that I could take data and talk about it! The thing that has always impressed me about you is that you have treated me exactly the same, whether I was anchoring the whole thing, or whether I was a 22-year-old junior reporter in the newsroom, and it's been very much appreciated. Like A Star is Born, you have to be nice on the way up, cos some day, you'll be on the way back down.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-26/legendary-abc-chief-election-analyst-antony-green-to-step-down/104977638
New bulk-billing funding won't sway this GP clinic,Hobart doctors say federal Labor and Coalition election promise to increase bulk billing not 'viable',2025-02-25 09:36:44,"Siblings Jay and Emma Shoemaker opened their general practice in Hobart's CBD less than a year ago, and in that time, it's grown to house eight full-time doctors. It's a welcome change in Tasmania, where appointments are usually hard to come by. ""I think one of the main reasons why a lot of the GP clinics locally have been forced to shut their doors is because they're just not able to cover costs with the current level of funding,"" Dr Emma Shoemaker said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the policy on Sunday in Tasmania, and it has now been matched by the Coalition. (AAP: Rob Burnett) There's no bulk billing at their practice, which is not unusual. No GP clinic in Tasmania offers bulk billing to a new adult patient without concessions, according to online GP directory Cleanbill. The current amount paid by the Medicare rebate and bulk-billing incentive, which is on a per consultation basis, just is not high enough to cover the cost, according to Dr Jay Shoemaker. The average out-of-pocket cost for a GP visit has risen by 4.1 per cent nationally over the past year, with patients in Tasmania, the ACT and NSW paying the most. The federal government has unveiled its primary health pitch to voters for the upcoming election, offering a higher incentive for doctors to bulk bill all patients — instead of just kids and concession card holders. The Coalition has since matched the pledge. Under the plan, it said nine out of 10 GP visits would be bulk billed by 2030, with an additional 18 million 'free' appointments by 2030. The Shoemaker siblings opened their Hobart clinic less than a year ago, and since then it's grown to eight full-time doctors. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) None of those patients will be at the Shoemakers' clinic. ""Ultimately, in order to make this new funding model viable, you'd have to move through patients a lot quicker,"" Dr Emma Shoemaker said. They say even with the increase of about $70 per consultation, it's still not enough, compared to the AMA's recommended $100 mark. Federal Labor and the Coalition both want to expand the bulk-billing incentive to all Australians, to make nine out of 10 GP visits free by the end of the decade. ""The problem is that if GP clinics were to accept that payment as the full payment, we wouldn't be able to keep the doors open and provide any healthcare at this stage,"" Dr Jay Shoemaker said. The government has tied the money to the bulk-billing incentive to spur on more 'free' GP visits, but it means if the appointment isn't charged like that, the extra incentive won't be paid out. Dr Jay Shoemaker said patients would have been better off if the funding boost had been poured directly into the rebate, which would also reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. ""That would have meant that gap, instead of being $60, was $30, which would have been tremendous to sort of relieve the economic pressures at the moment for patients,"" he said. The Coalition quickly matched the Labor government's election pledge, meaning it will be enacted — no matter who forms government. It also includes a 12.5 per cent bonus if all of a clinic's appointments in a single quarter are bulk billed, and funding for more training of healthcare professionals. The federal government has claimed the policy will triple the number of fully bulk-billing practices to 4,800 nationwide. Veteran Tasmanian GP Dr Glenn Richardson, said the bipartisanship was an acknowledgement of ""gross underfunding of GP services"" over the past two to three decades. But he doubted the new incentive levels would create a big change in the ways that clinics currently bill patients — with many clinics 'mixed billing'. ""People who truly are poor or pensioners, or under 16, or [have] healthcare cards have been given bulk billing for a long, long time, and what happens is the people who pay an [out-of-pocket amount are subsidising the people who are bulk billed,"" he said. Dr Glenn Richardson believes Medicare is no longer doing the job it was designed to do. (ABC News: Morgan Timms) He said Medicare was no longer fit for purpose, with complex patients taking much longer to work through. ""It's too little, too late for general practice — the boat sailed, really,"" he said. While the Coalition matched Sunday's announcement from Labor, health and access to health services was still front of mind for voters at Hobart's bus mall in the seat of Clark. In the Hobart CBD, Elizabeth said she was supportive of the focus on bulk-billing access, as someone who regularly sees a doctor. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) Elizabeth told the ABC she sees a GP every three weeks as she recovers from a broken bone and a major depressive disorder. She said she regularly schedules her appointments weeks ahead, and has struggled to get one at short notice. ""I have tried to get, like, a same day or same week appointment, and it's been a 'No she's got nothing until the middle of next month' kind of thing,"" Elizabeth said. She was supportive of improvements to bulk-billing access. ""It's been a really long time since bulk billing has been common, it used to be that the exception would be that you pay the gap, and now that's the norm."" Chris has been battling cancer for years and is thankful his doctor bulk bills — but said many are struggling to get in to see a GP. (ABC News: Luke Bowden) Chris and Sandra have been attending the same GP throughout his four-year battle with bowel cancer, and were thankful their clinic bulk billed. Labor set a policy trap for the Coalition in the shape of Medicare funding, then Peter Dutton sidestepped it by shouting ""me too"". But they have family members struggling to find a GP.

Labor pledges to expand voice and SMS coverage across Australia,Voice and SMS services to be included in universal service obligation under Labor re-election pledge,2025-02-27 10:42:48,"Access to voice and SMS calls would be extended to huge areas of reception dead zones across the country as part of Labor's pledge to include mobile phone services in the universal service obligation. Currently, only broadband internet via the NBN and landline and payphone telephone access are included in the universal service obligation (USO), a long-standing policy that ensures all Australians have access to some level of communication technology. Telstra, which is paid $270 million a year to guarantee voice calls via landlines and payphones, argues the USO is outdated and should cover a mix of technologies including mobile, fixed and satellite services. Labor's proposal is the universal outdoor mobile obligation, a plan that will use low-orbit satellites to deliver voice and SMS services to areas of the country that are not connected to the land-based 4G and 5G networks. ""The Universal Outdoor Mobile Obligation will improve public safety, increase resilience during natural disasters, and provide an extra layer of coverage in areas previously thought too difficult or costly to reach,"" Communications minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement. All phones will be able to take advantage of this service, and Ms Rowland said a re-elected Labor government would partner with the University of Technology Sydney to expand mobile compatibility testing. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland says Labor will ensure mobile voice and SMS services are included in a new outdoor universal service obligation. (Supplied: Michelle Rowland) Companies like Star Link, Link Global, AST SpaceMobile and Vodaphone Global have made rapid progress in establishing fleets of low earth orbit satellites that when combined with ""direct to device"" technology, transmit a signal that can reach many recently-released smartphones. Labor's policy would require Australian telecommunications companies to partner with a satellite provider in order to ensure basic voice calls and SMS could be made in areas of the country where phones get no reception at all. Once operational, access to emergency calls, basic coverage in existing 'black spots' and better mobile access in the wake of natural disasters would all improve. The technology was used by United States telecommunications company T-Mobile in partnership with SpaceX in the wake of the Los Angeles fires to provide voice calls and SMS services. T-Mobile has launched 477 satellites through SpaceX in a bid to provide coverage to around 129.5 million hectares (500,000 square miles) of the USA not covered by any wireless phone provider. It is a different technology to the ""satellite SOS"" provided by companies like Apple, which only provides access to emergency calls when a triple-0 call has failed to connect to a mobile tower. Ms Rowland said low-orbit satellites and direct-to-device technology is a good fit for Australia. ""The experience will be different to land mobile networks, but the benefits transformative, particularly for a large continent such as ours."" The Productivity Commission slammed the universal service obligation as 'anachronistic and costly' in a 2017 report. Just last year, the Telecommunications Ombudsman, Cynthia Gebert said she agreed, and the USO should be updated in line with the way most Australians engage with mobile phones. Australians might be surprised to learn that the only phone services guaranteed by the federal government are landlines and payphones. But in 2024, it's asking whether that's the minimum Australians should expect — and pay for. Last year, Telstra said the universal services obligation's current framework was too inflexible and more technologies should be included in the mix. ""We think it's time for the USO to be met through a range of technologies, reflecting advances in modern, 21st-century technology advancements that improve customer experiences,"" the telco wrote in a blog post last year. The policy will not replace the existing Mobile Black Spot Program and Mobile Network Hardening Program, which Ms Rowland said will continue under a re-elected Labor government.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-25/labor-pledges-expansion-of-voice-and-sms-coverage/104976030
Senator threatens climate body after nuclear 'carbon bomb' report,"Nuclear path would blow out Australia's emissions targets, new modelling shows",2025-02-24 18:18:32,"A senior Liberal senator has suggested the head of the country's leading climate body could be sacked if the Coalition wins the election, after the organisation released independent modelling into the party's nuclear plan. The Climate Change Authority has modelled the potential impacts of the Coalition's promise to build seven nuclear power plants by 2050, and concluded it would result in an additional 2 billion tonnes of emissions. In response, Senator Jane Hume suggested that the head of the Climate Change Authority, former state Liberal party minister Matt Kean, could be removed from the role. ""We could not possibly maintain a Climate Change Authority that has been so badly politicised,"" she told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing. Shadow Finance Minister Jane Hume suggested it would be difficult to keep Mr Kean as chair if the Coalition won the federal election. (Australian Senate) When asked specifically if the opposition would keep Kean on as chair, she said ""that is not a decision for me but I could not imagine maintaining a commission that is so badly politicised that it is not serving its purpose to provide independent advice to government on its climate change policy. Where is that policy? Where is the target of 2035?"" Her comments refer to the authority's role to provide a report to the government on what the country's 2035 climate targets should be. That report was delayed to reassess how Donald Trump's election would impact the global climate world. The Climate Change Authority is an independent body established under legislation. It has a mandate to advise governments on policies around climate change and the country's emissions and said this modelling was firmly within its remit. ""The Climate Change Authority is a scientific-backed organisation. We put the science and the facts on the table for the Australian public to make up their minds,"" Mr Kean told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing. ""What is political in fact is people that deny science and deny basic economics in their policies, that's what political looks like. And that is what Ted O'Brien is doing,"" Mr Kean told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing. ""The Climate Change Authority Act 2011 empowers the authority to undertake self-initiated research on matters relating to climate change. This work was not requested or directed by the Australian government."" The agency found adopting the Coalition’s nuclear plan would result in an additional 2 billion tonnes of emission, the equivalent of 200 years' worth of emissions from Australia's domestic flights. It compared the current trajectory modelled by the country's energy market operator, AEMO, with the Coalition's nuclear modelling that was released in December. The increase in emissions would come from delaying the rollout of renewable technology and instead continuing with coal-fired power, which is otherwise expected to shut down over the next decade, and slowing the transitions in other industries. Emissions in the National Electricity Market would be higher every year until the late 2040s under the nuclear pathway. (Supplied: Climate Change Authority) Mr Kean said the Coalition's plan would deliver a ""carbon emissions bomb"" and pursuing the current trajectory was ""the only viable option"". ""Continuing on Australia's current pathway and accelerating our progress can deliver rapid cuts to emissions,"" he said. ""Prioritising nuclear at this time would be inconsistent with Australia's national emissions reduction priorities and commitments. Matt Kean says pursuing nuclear power does not align with Australia's climate goals. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts) With climate change, the journey is more important than the final destination. CO2 stays in the atmosphere and it's the build-up of these emissions over time that causes hotter temperatures and more extreme weather, so how quickly you reduce emissions is more important than reaching zero by a certain date. By the time nuclear will be fully deployed, there will be one billion MtCo2 in added emissions from the electricity sector alone. (Supplied: Climate Change Authority) Under the Coalition's nuclear plan, Australia would also blow out its 2030 emissions targets by more than 5 per cent, according to the authority's modelling, and is in line with 2.6 degrees of warming. It's not just the electricity system that would have higher emissions under a nuclear pathway. The Coalition's own modelling assumes that there's a slower uptake of other clean technologies and a smaller economy overall, adding another billion tonnes to the tally. The transport sector will cut emissions faster if clean technology options like electric cars can be charged with a low-emissions grid. Manufacturers would also produce more emissions with a dirtier grid until nuclear came online. The authority combined these assumptions with the impact of using coal-fired power for longer, until nuclear reactors are built, to arrive at the additional 2 billion tonnes of emissions. Other industries are also relying on a clean grid to reduce emissions. Under the current pathway, Australia's electricity emissions are forecast to drop significantly between now and 2035. By waiting to build a nuclear fleet, electricity emissions would stay higher for much longer. These are the numbers you should keep in mind when thinking about its place in Australia's energy transition. Australia currently has a target to reach 82 per cent renewables in the electricity mix by the end of this decade. The current pathway is outlined by AEMO and is broadly supported by state governments, industry, as well as the current federal Labor government. Under the Coalition's nuclear plan, nuclear and renewables wouldn't reach 82 per cent of the grid until 2042, or another 12 years later than the current path. Coalition's own nuclear modelling, which was conducted by Frontier Economics, also found that cumulative emissions would be higher under its plan. In an earlier response to the modelling, shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy Ted O'Brien had also questioned the credibility of the Climate Change Authority. ""The Climate Change Authority has sadly become a puppet of Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen, as its latest report parrots Labor's untruthful anti-nuclear scare campaign,"" Mr O'Brien said in a statement. Ted O'Brien slammed the Climate Change Authority's modelling, questioning its credibility as an independent government body. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) Mr O'Brien did not respond directly to the finding of 2 billion tonnes of additional emissions but instead highlighted the fact that their plan would fall below the current pathway in 2049. It’s not the first time the opposition has taken aim at Australia’s independent expert bodies over nuclear power.  In March they questioned the credibility of the CSIRO after releasing a report about the feasibility of nuclear power in Australia.   Despite regularly updating its research to incorporate requests from nuclear proponents, the CSIRO has consistently found nuclear power to be more expensive than renewables supported by batteries.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/nuclear-plan-for-australia-adds-2bn-emissions/104973080
Dutton paints Labor as big spender but on Medicare he said 'me too',Labor's new Medicare policy could have been an election trap but the Coalition said 'me too',2025-02-24 04:46:58,"There's a point in the political cycle — often on the cusp of the election campaign — best described as the ""me-too"" phase.  We have entered this phase in the past few weeks with two key moments that demonstrate the thesis.  First, it was Labor. And yesterday, it was the Liberals who jumped up, broke with their rhetoric and principles, and shouted ME TOO, agreeing to back their opponent's policy to end what they see as a political freight train coming at them. The Coalition promised yesterday not to stand in the way of Labor's $8.5 billion boost to Medicare funding unveiled by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.  The average out-of-pocket cost for a GP visit has risen by 4.1 per cent nationally over the past year, with patients in Tasmania, the ACT and NSW paying the most. After three years of complaining about what the Coalition has painted as Labor's reckless spending, that fiscal discipline was out the door yesterday in favour of political safety.  The Liberals — spotting a giant trap being elaborately set for them before polling day — sidestepped it by promising to ""me too"" the Labor policy.  Peter Dutton knows Labor wants the election campaign to be a referendum on health and Medicare. He was not going to help Labor by opposing their big free-doctor spend even though it breaks with the concept he has pushed of needing to put a break on government spending.  The same happened a few days ago with the money to save the Whyalla steelworks (don't call it a bailout even though it looks like one.) The opposition leader has been trying to paint himself as the real champion of the working class and he wasn't going to oppose the Commonwealth saving steelworkers' jobs. No one is prepared to rumble with blue collar workers. Labor did its own about-face at the end of the parliamentary fortnight.  Labor broke with their longstanding policy opposing mandatory sentencing, passing tough anti-hate crime laws that will impose minimum jail sentences. Only a few weeks earlier, the PM had told us he was against mandatory sentences.  The opposition leader, too, has been busy warning that the Albanese government is ""Whitlam-esque"", a slur that is meant to sting and suggest they are big spenders. But it is unlikely to mean a lot to millions of new and young Australians who are doubtful to know what the Whitlam government was responsible for. Prime minister warns of possibility of Coalition cuts to Medicare. In his final words in parliament last year, former Labor leader Bill Shorten delivered some parting advice to his colleagues that looks to have resonated.  Speeches from former leaders are almost always loaded with messages and many in the party listened carefully, respectfully, but also nervously.  He said, pointedly, ""Labor is always at its best when we know who and what we are fighting for."" On two fronts this week it looks like the Albanese government is constructing targeted fights that define who they are and who they want to fight for.  After a long period of seeming to be constantly reactive to events or to the terms set by the opposition leader, Labor has given us the clearest indication that it wants to be in charge of what this election contest is about. The Coalition will back in Labor's Medicare funding boost, committing to spend $9 billion to support GPs if they are elected at this year's federal election.  Yes, we all know cost of living is the number one issue but no one can reduce the price of groceries overnight, and voters are smart enough to know that.  So, Labor needs to fight on issues adjacent to cost of living — that give voters the promise of more money in their pockets where it matters most. And nothing matters more to people than their health. The first rule of politics is to fight on your most comfortable and advantageous territory — to define the contest on your terms and to crystallise the choice. The latest Essential poll showed many Australians say they are not aware of the Labor government's key economic achievements and policies, with Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton neck-and-neck. This is the kind of promise that — if sold correctly — could be remembered.  It's not a word-salad policy, it's simple. Free doctor visits.  By me too-ing the policy, Dutton has made it less of a fight — but we are still talking about health, right?  And Labor figures if we are talking about health the public will be more sympathetic and trusting of Labor. Dutton on the other hand is on defence — trying to neutralise the accusation that he would take an axe to health. The second fight Labor is trying to mount is harder for the opposition leader to me too. On this, Labor has been spoiling for a cage fight for weeks. Employment and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt announced this week he is intervening in the Fair Work Commission hearing to support retail workers trying to stop their penalty rates from being taken away by big retailers, including Woolworths, Coles, Kmart, Costco and 7-Eleven. The unions claim that the Fair Work Commission's ruling could impact more than a million workers, including 360,000 permanent workers in key award-reliant sectors and 660,000 workers on enterprise agreements or contracts that these awards underpin. Now, the unions are calling on Peter Dutton to join retail workers and the government in opposing this bid to ""wipe out retail penalty rates by big business."" Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you. And they are trying to construct a much bigger fight, saying a roll-back on penalty rates in retail could trigger further challenges to penalty rates across other award-reliant industries, including hospitality, healthcare, fast food and administration.  So far, the opposition has been cautious on industrial relations, too — they know this trap because it smashed them in 2007 when Labor and the unions ran the successful campaign against Workchoices.  At a time of great anxiety about pay and conditions, defining the fight on workers rights is again a Labor strategy. In parts of working class Australia where Dutton wants to make inroads, the fight will be to scare them that their wages and conditions will go backwards under Dutton. All political leaders perform better when they are controlling the terms of the debate. All year the opposition leader has been able to bring the contest back to national security and strength. Labor has been desperate to get off his turf.  The big question is, how long can they keep him on theirs? Patricia Karvelas will interview PM Anthony Albanese tonight on Q+A at 9.35pm on ABC TV.  As well as presenter of ABC TV's Q+A, Karvelas is host of ABC News Afternoon Briefing at 4pm weekdays on ABC News Channel, co-host of the weekly Party Room podcast with Fran Kelly and host of politics and news podcast Politics Now.

Labor's 'legacy-defining' Medicare election pitch to voters,GP visits to become free for most under $8.5b 'legacy defining' Labor Medicare promise,2025-02-23 12:10:19,"Labor is promising nine out of 10 GP visits will be free from out-of-pocket expenses by 2030 under a cornerstone pre-election pitch to voters struggling with rising healthcare costs. In what the government claims will be the largest single investment in Medicare since its inception more than four decades ago, Labor will spend $8.5 billion over four years, including to triple incentives to doctors to provide near universal bulk-billing. On top of 18 million extra bulk-billed GP visits per year, Labor is also promising 400 nursing scholarships and 2,000 new GP trainees a year by 2028. Anthony Albanese unveiled Labor's Medicare funding policy at a campaign rally in Launceston. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough) Labor believes its ""legacy-defining"" package, which the government says has been funded without additional taxes or savings, will prompt voters to shy away from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and the Coalition's promised return to spending restraint. But as the prime minister unveiled his policy to cheers at a rally in Launceston on Sunday, Mr Dutton and shadow health minister Anne Ruston announced they would match Labor's funding pledge ""dollar for dollar"". ""I want every Australian to know they only need their Medicare card, not their credit card, to receive the healthcare they need,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. The promise of expanded bulk-billing is likely to be welcomed by financially-stretched voters, particularly families and younger cohorts who have reported an increasing tendency to delay or cancel visits to doctors because of likely up-front cost.  The government has cited one ABS estimate that around 8.8 per cent of visits are delayed on such grounds. The number of people in their 20s not going to the doctor has tripled because of cost over the past three years. But Labor's plan will also depend heavily on whether doctors take up the proposed incentive, particularly in metropolitan areas where rents and staff costs are higher. New bulk-billing data shows a slight improvement to 77.5 per cent of GP visits being bulk-billed. The Royal Australian College of GPs says it has a plan to restore that rate to pre-COVID levels. The government's promise goes beyond calls by the nation's doctors this month for free GP visits to be expanded beyond the current system that covers people aged 16 or younger and concession-card holders to everyone under 35.  However, it does not address the overall rebate structure, which doctors say is too low to cover the cost of common GP visits such as longer consults for mental health care. Depending on location, Labor proposes to make doctor visits free for all Australians by boosting Medicare rebates to $69.56 from $42.85 for a standard consult in a metropolitan area, to as much as $86.91 in a remote area. Those increases include an extra 12.5 per cent that will be paid to practices that switch to bulk-billing only. The government anticipates that its incentives will see the number of fully bulk-billed practices triple to around 4,800 over the next five years. The current number of clinics is estimated by the government at between 7,000 and 8,000. Australia's doctors this month called for free GP visits to be expanded to cover people aged 16 or younger and concession-card holders to everyone under 35. (AAP: Julian Smith) Labor says patients would save around $859 million a year by 2030 in out-of-pocket costs. The cost to the taxpayer of the bulk-billing expansion when it begins in November if Labor is re-elected starts at $1.1 billion in 2025-26 rising to $2.4 billion in 2028-29. Over the first four years, the total will reach $8.5 billion. Government sources said the ""majority"" of that cost was factored into December's mid-year budget update, with the rest to be accounted for in the forthcoming ""budget update"". The package means ""nine out of 10 GP visits will be bulk billed by 2030"", the government said. It is understood that number includes more than 80 federally funded ""urgent care"" clinics. As of December, some 77.5 per cent of all GP visits were bulk-billed nationally, which is around 7.8 out of every 10 visits, according to calculations by the ABC. The bulk-billing incentive is a payment to encourage doctors to directly bill Medicare for services, reducing or eliminating a patient's out-of-pocket costs. Labor in 2023 tripled the incentive that currently applies to children under 16 and pensioners and concession card holders. Speculation has been growing for months that Labor would unveil additional cost-of-living relief in the lead-up to the next federal election, due no later than May 17. Mr Albanese will showcase the bulk-billing announcement at a US-style campaign rally in Launceston on Sunday, where he will brand Mr Dutton as a Medicare wrecker. ""Labor built Medicare, we will protect it and improve it for all Australians,"" he said. Health Minister Mark Butler said Mr Dutton sought to end bulk-billing with a co-payment in 2014 and then froze rebates for six years. ""There is no question that when it comes to Medicare, you'll be worse off under Dutton."" The Coalition rejects those charges, pointing to figures showing the GP bulk-billing rate rose from 82.5 per cent in 2013, when Tony Abbott became prime minister, to 88.5 per cent at the time of 2022 election. That period included a surge during the pandemic. It has since declined to 77.5 per cent. The government believes that rate is likely to keep falling without action. On Sunday, the Coalition committed to investing $9 billion into Medicare, by matching Labor's pledge on top of an earlier promise of $500 million for mental health support. ""The Coalition recognises the urgent need for better access to bulk billed services in the middle of Labor’s healthcare crisis,"" Mr Dutton and Ms Ruston said in a joint statement.  ""That is why a Dutton Coalition government will match the $8.5 billion investment into Medicare dollar-for-dollar to fix Labor’s mess and restore bulk billing back up to Coalition levels.""

Trump is blowing up the post-World War II order as Australia watches on,Australian politics remains stubbornly local as geopolitical situation deteriorates,2025-02-22 04:00:00,"On the other side of the world this week, the US president was not just leaving Ukraine to its fate, and appearing to side with Russia's Vladimir Putin, he was up-ending the post-World War II order built around US and Western European cooperation and security. On this side of the world, the most common question government ministers seemed to be being asked was when the federal election would be called. Beyond the normal posturing of a faux election campaign, there is something particularly strange about the fact the rapidly shifting, and deteriorating, global situation does not seem to be resonating with our political leaders and debate. Peter Dutton certainly called out President Trump's remarks as ""dead wrong"" after Trump attacked Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a ""dictator"" who could soon lose his country. But this was only after his earlier flattery of the US president as a ""big thinker"" in response to Trump's calls for the US to take over Gaza, saying he brought ""gravitas"" to international affairs. Not even this week's next-level stage of Trump geopolitics on Ukraine, however, seems to have shifted us out of a space where our leaders convey any sense that they have given any deep or serious thought to the implications of what the president of our most powerful ally — and the one to which we have so aggressively hitched our star in recent years — is either saying or doing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese continues to chart an ultra-cautious path on all matters Trump, sounding for all the world like a leader who wishes the whole nightmare would just go away. ""Well, what I've said is that I won't give ongoing commentary on everything that Donald Trump says,"" Albanese told Melbourne radio on Thursday. Wielding hundreds of executive orders, Donald Trump has set about reshaping the US government during his first month in office. But in doing so, he's raised concerns of an impending constitutional crisis.  ""What I will do is say what Australia's position is and it's certainly unchanged. We regard the struggle of the Ukrainian people as being courageous. They are not only standing up for their national sovereignty, they are also standing up for the international rule of law. And Russia's invasion was illegal. It's been brutal. It's had catastrophic consequences for the people of Ukraine, but also, it must be said, for the people of Russia."" The ""running commentary"" response has worked to date. But the question of whether it can be confidently expected to do so even over the next few months — when we will eventually get to a federal polling day — is another matter. This week, we have seen leaders in western Europe forced to move from fumbling cautious politeness to action as a result of the US president's various pronouncements. There's no reason to think Australia's national interests will not be directly challenged in a similar way, whether that is over economic or geo-strategic interests, or even over political fashion. A worldwide shift to the hard right, as exemplified by Trump, might have given the Coalition some political encouragement. But as this shift has been turned into wilder and wilder pronouncements, with real world implications, that becomes a riskier proposition if the costs and uncertainty of such a shift resonate with voters. The Australian political debate seems particularly slow and parochial by comparison with what is happening overseas. The prime minister and his ministers move methodically through a list of one political problem to another ahead of the final calling of the poll, with policy solutions of very variable quality. It moved to neutralise the issue of the so-called NZYQ cohort of convicted criminals who the High Court ruled could not be held in indefinite detention after their services were served by announcing an (unspecified) deal to move three of them to Nauru. Albanese wrote to Tasmanian salmon industry leaders last weekend, vowing to ""introduce"" special legislation (unspecified or detailed) ""to ensure appropriate environmental laws are in place to continue sustainable salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour"". The PM has backed in salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour, but the industry is facing fights on multiple fronts on the other side of the state. This as he noted that ""it is clear to me the Environment Protection and Diversity Conservation Act… does not allow for a common sense solution on an acceptable timeline"". That would be the federal government's primary piece of environmental legislation he is talking about, and the one under which his environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, had ordered a review of aquaculture in the harbour. So the PM wants legislation to override the government's own legislation. Whatever the merits or otherwise of either case, it smacks of the worst sort of pre-election expediency. The government is desperate to win the seat of Braddon — which runs down Tasmania's west coast and includes Macquarie Harbour and the neighbouring town of Strahan — from the Liberal Party. But doing so also risks losing the seat of Franklin, held by one of his own ministers — Julie Collins — to an anti-salmon farming campaign being run by community independent Peter George. There's been lots of other strapping down the furniture going on in the past week or two, including matching the Coalition's proposed ban on foreign investors in existing residential housing for two years, even though most analysts say it will have little effect on the market. The government is bailing out both Rex Airlines and the Whyalla steelworks. There are legitimate arguments to be made for doing both in an era when we have become more aware of supply chain vulnerabilities and imperfect markets, and less brutal about the needs of private sector competition at all costs. But equally, there have been lots of questions raised about the management of both these operations, and it's not clear who might emerge to buy them. The structure of the Whyalla deal does not go as far as anticipating on-going government ownership but is structured to go much further than just keeping the doors open. But it doesn't hurt that the deal reinforces the prime minister's broader political message about the importance of making things in Australia.  Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Albanese projects supreme confidence about his chances of leading Labor into another term of government. He believes he has Dutton squarely in his sights on the cost of living issue. The Coalition's blocking of a range of cost of living measures announced by the government, and its positioning as the frugal alternative that will get inflation — and interest rates — down faster, leaves the PM thinking the opposition leader is vulnerable on the issue. But the reception to this week's long-awaited announcement of a first interest rate cut shows just how hard a road that is for the government. Yes, rates are finally coming down but the sense of any relief being felt in people's pockets is marginal, and trickles through slowly. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington The declaration from RBA Governor Michelle Bullock that there won't be any imminent further cuts only increases the likelihood of more cost of living spending measures being announced before polling day. There's a broader issue that the spectre of Trump — and his fellow populist travellers — leave hanging over Australian politics. Like many left of centre parties, Labor here is caught often fighting the last war: to persuade voters that it is a steady pair of hands on policy, whether that is economic management or foreign policy. ""I believe in shaping change, but I'm not someone who wants to disrupt… I want to bring people with the government on that journey of change,"" the PM said this week. Similarly, Labor has a long held commitment to trying to manage and sustain the institutions of government that deliver public services, even when the global political stage is dominated by those who revel in blowing them up. ""It takes time you can't change the whole country in one term, we're functioning, we're orderly,"" Albanese also said. That is a hard message to sell to voters who feel hard done by and that little in their world is either functioning, or orderly.

"The RBA didn't want to start cutting rates too late, governor Bullock says","The RBA didn't want to start cutting rates too late, governor Bullock says",2025-02-21 16:10:01,"The Reserve Bank was too slow to begin lifting interest rates to tackle rising inflation, and it doesn't want to make the same mistake when cutting rates, RBA governor Michele Bullock has told a parliamentary committee. Appearing at the House Economics Committee in Canberra on Friday, Ms Bullock said the RBA Board cut the cash rate target this week for many reasons. She explained inflation has declined sufficiently in Australia, private demand has clearly softened, and wages growth has slowed down ""more or less in-line"" with the RBA's forecasts, which warranted a small rate cut. The Reserve Bank board cuts interest rates, decreasing the cash rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 4.1 per cent. But she said the RBA Board was also mindful of a possible mistake it made a few years ago, which it doesn't want to repeat. ""What's also playing on the board's mind is that the board also doesn't want to be late [in cutting rates],"" Ms Bullock said. ""Arguably we were late raising interest rates on the way up. We didn't respond as quickly as we should have to rising inflation. ""I think the board has been quite cognisant of the fact … that if we're going to start reducing interest rates, then we need to be thinking of doing it not when we are already back in the [2-3 per cent target] band, but as we start to get more confidence we're coming back to the band,"" she said. The RBA Board cut the cash rate target from 4.35 per cent to 4.1 per cent on Tuesday. It was the first interest rate cut in Australia since the RBA lifted interest rates 13 times — between May 2022 and November 2023 — to get inflation under control. The Reserve Bank boss says policymakers are flying into uncharted economic territory, and the RBA will ""take the time"" to figure out what is going on before raising interest rates. The RBA has been criticised by some commentators for its decision to cut rates this week. They've argued the decision is premature and it risks undermining the RBA's inflation-fighting efforts. But Ms Bullock reminded federal MPs on Friday that monetary policy operates with a lag and that has to be taken into account when thinking about the RBA's rate cut this week. Previously, RBA officials have said it can take anywhere between 12 and 24 months for an interest rate movement to work its way through the economy. Ms Bullock said the RBA arguably took too long to lift interest rates a few years ago, when the pace of inflation had already picked up quickly in 2021, and the RBA Board didn't want to repeat that mistake during this rate-cutting cycle. Her admission was noteworthy, from a political point of view. Back in 2021 and early 2022, the RBA received a lot of criticism when its central banking peers in comparable countries were starting to lift interest rates in response to the increase in inflation globally, and the RBA wasn't joining them. The RBA only started lifting rates in May 2022, which was in the middle of Australia's federal election campaign. Ms Bullock joined the RBA Board in April 2022 after she became deputy governor. She replaced former deputy governor Guy Debelle, who resigned from the bank in March 2022. RBA governor Michele Bullock at a press conference after cutting rates in February 2025. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts) By that time, inflation in Australia was already running at an annual pace of 5 per cent. And when the RBA finally lifted rates, it lifted the cash rate target from 0.1 per cent to 0.35 per cent — which was still incredibly low by historical standards. This year's federal election needs to be held on or before 17 May 2025, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hasn't chosen the date yet. On Friday, regarding this week's rate cut, Ms Bullock said the RBA Board had also bought itself ""a bit of insurance"" with its last rate increase in late 2023, and that had given it some wriggle room to cut rates now. Rate cuts are like cockroaches: there's rarely just one. But the RBA board has warned households and financial markets not to expect an infestation. ""In November 2023 we raised interest rates again, by 25 basis points to 4.35 per cent, and we copped quite a lot of criticism of that at the time. People said, 'You've overdone it,'"" she said. ""We'd taken out a bit of insurance. We've removed that now because we think it's still a prudent move. ""But again, all of those things I've cited, we're going to need to see continued progress in all of those things in order to continue to get more confidence that we're going to be sustainably back in the [2-3 per cent inflation target] band. ""We think we're going to be back in the band this year. ""But again, it's not enough to be just back. You've actually got to be thinking you're going to be sustainably there.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-21/rba-did-not-want-cut-rates-too-late-michele-bullock-governor/104964220
How the Coalition responds to further cost-of-living relief is anyone's guess,How the Coalition responds to further cost-of-living relief is anyone's guess,2025-02-20 04:00:00,"We might not know when the election campaign will start, but one thing is almost certain: Labor will promise more cost-of-living relief. It sees this week's interest rate cut as vindication of its economic strategy to date and has been emboldened by the comments of the Reserve Bank Governor. Less certain is how the Coalition will respond to this further household support. Does it rail against more wasteful spending? Or reverse course and back the handouts? Whether it comes before or after the starter's gun is fired on the campaign, the promise of more support is set to crystallise the economic debate that's raged since the last election. Has government spending at a time of high inflation been reckless or responsible? Labor appears more than happy for that debate to dominate the campaign. Chalmers has been emboldened to stick with his strategy and offer more cost-of-living relief. (ABC News: John Gunn) Jim Chalmers insists he's working towards a Budget being delivered on March 25, even if few believe Anthony Albanese will wait that long to call the election. Whether it comes in the Budget or as a campaign promise, the Treasurer gave his strongest indication yesterday of what we can all expect. ""If people are looking for hints about what the fourth budget will contain"", the Treasurer told Radio National, ""the hints are in the first three"". He went on to remind listeners this included ""substantial and meaningful and responsible cost-of-living help"". 'Worst of inflation is behind us': Jim Chalmers address interest rate cuts The opposition, having laid blame for inflation at the feet of government profligacy, has been promising ""belt tightening"" and spending cuts as the answer. It's specifically called the government's energy bill relief a ""band-aid on a bullet wound"". And yet, with an election looming, the Coalition is now keeping its options open. ""We'll wait and see what the government's proposing,"" Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said, on the widely anticipated prospect of Labor promising another $300 rebate for the coming financial year. This is where policy purity meets election reality for the Coalition. Is Peter Dutton willing to stand in the way of households receiving an extra $300 during an election campaign? Can he convince voters this sort of government spending will only delay another rate cut? No sooner had the Reserve Bank cut interest rates did governor Michele Bullock find herself being asked the obvious question — should households expect more? After announcing the rate cut decision, the Reserve Bank Governor did little to encourage any such argument. If anything, Michelle Bullock gave the green light for the government to go ahead with more relief. ""Cost-of-living relief, I should point out, is really helpful for households"", Bullock argued. ""It does really help the financial pressure they're under. So, it's important."" The Governor offered no criticism of previous government support or warnings against more being delivered. She even echoed the government's argument about the importance of maintaining employment while bringing inflation down. This is the so-called ""soft landing"" that's avoided long jobless queues. Bullock defended the way both monetary and fiscal policy have succeeded in delivering ""a really positive outcome"". If the rate cut was a pre-election gift, these comments were the cherry on top for a government that's often struggled to convince unhappy voters of its economic strategy. That doesn't mean struggling households will necessarily be dancing in the streets in celebration, revising their judgements on how the economy has been managed. Labor still has much work to do in the campaign to convince voters better times are ahead and that it has a second term agenda worth supporting. But the government can now point to interest rates starting to fall, real wages continuing to grow –yesterday's figures showed a fifth consecutive quarter of wage growth – and continued strength in the jobs market. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Chalmers has been emboldened to stick with his strategy and offer more cost-of-living relief, whether in a pre-election budget or as a campaign promise. The Coalition, meanwhile, is about to face a test. Will it hold the line on spending restraint in the heat of a campaign? Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington For now, the opposition is highlighting the slow recovery in living standards, and the fact another rate cut is no sure thing. Its alternative approach, however, remains unclear. Dutton wants to leave some big decisions until after the election. The extent of spending cuts would be worked out in office, he says. The shape of immigration cuts would be done in consultation with the department. But when the government rolls out its next round of cost-of-living relief in the coming weeks, households will want to know where the Coalition stands.

"Clive Palmer, Pauline Hanson trade barbs over failed bid to unify parties","Clive Palmer, Pauline Hanson trade barbs over failed bid to unify parties",2025-02-19 16:37:52,"Clive Palmer and Pauline Hanson traded barbs after an attempt to unify their party fell apart, over disagreements about who should lead and bankroll their hoped-for singular right-wing populist movement. Amid concern that a swathe of ""Australia First""-type groups and individuals may cannibalise each other's supporters at the upcoming election, Mr Palmer on Wednesday announced he would campaign on a Donald Trump-style platform. Mr Palmer's party will now operate under the banner of Trumpet of Patriots. The billionaire announced the new branding, which was chosen after he failed in a legal bid to re-register United Australia Party, in the wake of talks with One Nation on creating a unified movement. Those discussions are understood to have collapsed as Mr Palmer and One Nation accused the other of seeking to dominate the future party. Senator Hanson insisted on becoming the new movement's ""president for life"", Mr Palmer said, which was something the resources investor and political campaign funder said would not be possible. ""I said 'well you can't be president for life. Not even I can be president for life,'"" he said at a press conference in Canberra on Wednesday. A spokesman for Senator Hanson told the ABC that an approach was made by Mr Palmer but that ""One Nation isn't for sale"". One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson said her party was ""not for sale"". (AAP: Darren England) The stalled unification push comes as some of Australia's best known populist figures approach the later stages of already long political careers. The three best known individuals — Mr Palmer, Senator Hanson and Queensland independent Bob Katter — are well known political names, familiar to voters after racking up more than a combined century in public life. Both Mr Palmer and Senator Hanson are 70 years old, and Mr Katter is 79. Their continued dominance of what remains a niche political landscape — all have built careers tapping disaffected Coalition and right-wing Labor voters — appears to have blunted the ability of younger figures to emerge from under their shadows. Their failure to unite also raises fresh questions about the role of the far right at the upcoming election just as Donald Trump's return to the White House spurs renewed enthusiasm for hyper nationalistic nativist political figures. ""The entry of Clive Palmer's new party will further fragment the centre right minor party vote at the upcoming federal election,"" said Family First national director Lyle Shelton, who described the move as ""regrettable"". Mr Palmer in 2022 spent more than $120 million on election campaign material, but secured only one Senate seat for his now deregistered United Australia Party. Despite contesting almost every lower house seat at the last election, One Nation held only two Senate seats, including Senator Hanson's after nearly losing the spot to the Legalise Cannabis Australia party. Despite those weak results, both Mr Palmer and Senator Hanson's preferences are seen as a key factor in close-run contests. Senator Hanson claimed this week that she approached former National Party leader Barnaby Joyce to join One Nation. Mr Joyce rebuffed the offer. With speculation growing that neither Labor nor the Coalition will win a majority at the upcoming election, Mr Katter may yet become one of several kingmakers in the next parliament. Director of the Australian Studies Institute at the Australian National University Mark Kenny said many of today's leading populists are ""in the last gasp of their careers"". While the recurrence of Trumpism in the US should be a key moment for Mr Palmer and Senator Hanson, they are struggling to rise above being bit players. ""No matter what happens, whether there's an atmospheric change of the kind we're seeing, or there isn't one, they don't get a bigger stake in the game because sentiment has gone rightward and populist unless they find a way to get themselves dealt into the game,"" Mr Kenny said. ""None of these people have particularly long futures ahead in politics and there may be an element of needing to make a big play now because it'll all be over soon.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-19/clive-palmer-pauline-hanson-fail-unify-parties/104957330
It was the rate cut he wanted but Jim Chalmers knew not to smile,Jim Chalmers knew not to smile after the Reserve Bank announced its rate cut,2025-02-19 04:00:00,"There's some selective editing when the Coalition talks about interest rates. Be it the opposition leader Peter Dutton or the shadow treasurer Angus Taylor, they like to talk about the 12 times the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lifted the cash rate under Labor. But anyone with a mortgage knows all too well the RBA has raised interest rates 13 times since May 2022.  It's not like the Coalition forgets the first rise.  In power and on the ropes, the RBA's decision to start raising rates three weeks out from voters going to the polls was the last thing then prime minister Scott Morrison and his Coalition needed.  Labor has long held these outer-suburban electorates in Australia's mortgage belts. They might not be the most marginal but they will likely determine the election. ""If only you could pay your mortgage with Scott Morrison's excuses,"" Labor's Jim Chalmers said at the time. Irrespective of who won that election, the die was cast. Rates were always going up. And go up they did. Over 18 months, 12 rate rises constricted tighter and tighter around household budgets. They remained in that vice-like grip for a further 15 months, until yesterday's decision to cut rates for the first time since 2020. Albeit unintentionally, the RBA has found itself book-ending the electoral cycle, having started raising in the last campaign and now starting its cutting on the eve of the next one.  Though they would never admit it publicly, within the Coalition, senior figures knew in 2022 how hard the next three years were likely going to be. Speaking during the 2022 campaign, a senior figured privately noted the outlook was so bleak that it might well be an election where losing wasn't so bad.  Let the other lot deal with it, this person argued, forecasting the Coalition could knock Labor around over living costs and return to government after just one term in opposition. It was more a hope than a forecast. In the end, it hasn't proved too far from reality.  Voters, globally are fed up. Their wages have gone up nowhere near as much as prices have. They've taken their anger to the ballot box and turfed incumbent governments out around the world. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington In Australia, things are improving but easing inflation doesn't mean things are getting cheaper.  Overcoming the years of inflation outstripping wage growth will take much more than just one rate cut, something the now-treasurer noted after the RBA's decision. Keeping any trace of a smile away from his mouth, he addressed reporters soon after the RBA's decision. He insisted Australians needed and deserved the rate cut coming their way, announcing also that the major banks had given him assurances it would be passed on in full. Chalmers argued there was more work to do but what Australia was seeing was the soft landing he had long hoped for, with inflation easing without a surge in unemployment.  On paper, it might be the thing of dreams, but messaging to voters doing it tough that they are better off than they otherwise would have been will require astute communication. The Coalition's Angus Taylor quickly followed Chalmers, insisting the cut was too little, too late. He reminded voters they were paying thousands more in interest and their living standards were the worst they'd ever experienced. A Labor MP last week dubbed a rate cut as being crucial to keep Labor in the fight at this next election. The government is facing an electoral map more complicated than Scott Morrison's.  The party is bracing for major swings in the mortgage-belt areas of Melbourne's outer suburbs, in seats the party has long held.  Voters with mortgages in those electorates might soon be $100 a month better off. That compares with an increase in repayments of about $1,500 a month since the bank started raising rates.  The rate cut might have kept them in the fight. Winning the battle is a whole other thing.

TikTok is crucial for Gen Z voters and the PM is losing the battle,"Albanese and Dutton are battling on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Who's winning?",2025-02-18 05:21:30,"Peter Dutton and the Liberal Party are significantly outperforming Anthony Albanese and Labor in the contest for younger voters on TikTok as the federal election edges closer, analysis by ABC NEWS Verify shows. But since the beginning of last year, the prime minister has seen slightly higher-than-average interactions on posts on Instagram and Facebook, which are platforms popular with older voters. Social media will matter more than ever this election, with just under half of Australians using it to get their news, and nearly two-thirds of Gen-Z relying on it as their primary news source. ABC NEWS Verify analysed recent posts on the TikTok, Instagram and Facebook feeds of both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, as well as the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia accounts. Here's what we uncovered. Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. Video posts to TikTok show both the Liberals and Mr Dutton outperforming the incumbent government. The social media app claims to have more than 8.5 million active monthly users in Australia, making it a vital way to reach voters — especially younger ones. Analysis shows the Liberals are way ahead on average plays per video post despite Labor having been on the platform longer. The data was captured on February 5, so it is likely some videos have received more plays since then. Mr Dutton's videos, on average, are being played considerably more than Mr Albanese's too, though there is less data to compare because both leaders only started posting late last year. This is despite the prime minister posting more often than the opposition leader, with six video posts in December and 11 in January, against Mr Dutton's two in December and four in January. Mr Dutton's videos feature snippets of podcast interviews and a reaction video. But most address the viewer directly, with him looking straight at the camera. Susan Grantham, lecturer of communications at Griffith University, who researches the use of platforms such as TikTok in politics, said the Liberal Party TikTok account featured a lot of memes, while Mr Dutton's individual account focused more on the personal. ""You are very much seeing this separation between party memetic humour and individual political authenticity, which I think is really strong and definitely being noticed,"" Dr Grantham said. During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help. She said Mr Dutton had some advantage, having been on the platform slightly longer. The opposition leader first posted in September, while Mr Albanese first posted in December. Andrew Hughes, a marketing lecturer at the Australian National University who specialises in political marketing, told ABC NEWS Verify the Liberal Party clearly saw TikTok's advantages over other forms of communication. ""They look at it and go, 'We're not going to reach you on TV, radio, or other forms of media, but where I can really get you is on TikTok.' ""[They are] construct[ing] it for a younger audience — very targeted, very directed, and very specific. ""Labor's trying to put [Mr Dutton] into that category of being very negative, and a very dark personality, whereas the Coalition strategy is the complete opposite — which is to go shareable, likeable, 'Uncle Peter',"" he said. Dr Hughes speculated the Liberal Party account could be run by younger people considering its mix of shareable content such as memes, and clips from Mr Dutton's recent podcast appearances. ABC NEWS Verify understands both leaders are managing their social media accounts from within their offices, and both parties are managing their own social media accounts. It has been widely reported that the Liberals have enlisted support from Topham Guerin — an advertising agency credited with helping conservative parties retain or win power in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. ""They've gone outside really quickly in the campaign. They've got Topham Guerin in, who brought in their own team of people, who make this short-form content,"" Dr Hughes said. ""They don't care how rough it looks because that actually is more effective."" Neither the ALP nor the Liberal Party responded to questions about engaging external social media strategists. The fight for voters on Meta's platform Instagram is closer according to the data, captured on February 4. ABC NEWS Verify has calculated the account's average interactions by dividing the total number of monthly interactions by the total number of monthly posts to gain an insight into whether posts are performing better. Interactions on Instagram include liking and commenting on a post. Interactions do not indicate whether the person liking, commenting, or sharing the post was doing so in a positive or negative light. ""A lot of people who use social media … will say that all engagement is good engagement because of the fact that more people will then see your content."" Since the beginning of last year, the Liberals have had the edge on Labor for all but one month. However, Mr Albanese, on average, is far outperforming Mr Dutton. ""I would say that Anthony Albanese's account has a much more significant following because of the fact that he is our prime minister,"" Dr Grantham said. ""Instagram is an interesting platform because people tend to engage more heavily with issues, versus somewhere like TikTok, where it's … scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,"" she said. Dr Hughes thinks Labor and the prime minister could be doing better because their content is not targeted enough. ""I think it comes across as being too broad and not directed and specific enough on certain target groups,"" he said. The prime minister has also outperformed Mr Dutton on Meta's Facebook since the beginning of last year. Average monthly interactions show Mr Albanese in front in 11 of 13 months, with a considerable edge in January 2025. On the major parties' Facebook pages there is little daylight between them, with both seeing rising interactions in the past two months, suggesting more reactions, comments, and shares in the lead-up to the election. Dr Hughes said voters should look at what is being shared during the election campaign to understand who is winning the battle for attention on platforms. ""Is it the Labor content, the Albanese content, is it the Dutton content, or is it the Coalition content? ""I think it'll be quite revealing on who's being quite effective,"" he said.

She does her best to shelter her kids from the reality of the financial pressure she's under.

As a single mum of two, Mia McShane does her best to shelter her kids from the financial pressure she's facing. (ABC News: Jordan Young) She said keeping her home was her number one financial priority. Ms McShane will be keeping a close watch on the Reserve Bank's announcement on interest rates on Tuesday afternoon. ""It's come to the stage where you almost just hope for a hold [on rates],"" she said. There could soon be relief for households with a mortgage, with economists predicting an interest rate cut when the Reserve Bank board meets in February. So, what could it mean for your repayments? ""Obviously a decrease would be amazing, because even if it's $10 more a week, it'll make a huge difference."" Ms McShane's housing stress will be the number one factor driving her vote in the upcoming federal election. She thinks Labor is better positioned to make a difference based on their track record of offering rebates on power bills. ""They will just have the little person in mind. The single people, the low income earners all the ones that probably need the assistance,"" she said. Mia McShane is a working, single mum of two under mortgage stress and living in the marginal federal electorate of Lyons, in Tasmania. (ABC News: Jordan Young) Ms McShane lives in the marginal Tasmanian electorate of Lyons. It's held by Labor by just a 0.9 per cent margin, meaning only a small push would change the seat to the Liberals. According to Census data, the median household income per week in Lyons is $1,240, compared to $1,358 for the rest of Tasmania and $1,746 for Australia. A recent Four Corners investigation found this Tasmanian electorate, like many others across the country, is under acute financial stress. A total of 73.1 per cent of households in Lyons are under mortgage stress, 60.6 per cent are under rental stress and 69.7 per cent are experiencing household stress. Households with less than 5 per cent of their earnings left over after essentials are considered to be under financial stress. Carley Brown and her partner built their home in the Tasmanian electorate of Lyons three years ago when interest rates were low. (Supplied) Carley Brown and her partner are also stressed about their mortgage. ""I'm so invested in talking and like shouting from the rooftops to change how things are, because people cannot keep going on like this,"" Ms Brown said. She and her partner built their home in the electorate of Lyons three years ago when interest rates were low. A consumer group has advised Australians to ""shop around"" for cheaper groceries, but for people in regional areas, choice is a luxury they don't have. But everything changed when their fixed interest rate became variable. ""I haven't been able to get rid of the anxiety,"" she said. She can no longer afford to do a big fortnightly supermarket shop to stock up the freezer and the fridge. ""I go [to the shops] every couple of days and, you know, get the milk and the bread — and sort of think what will we do for tea tonight?"" she said. Ms Brown has cut back on the medical appointments she should be attending to manage several autoimmune conditions she suffers from. Like many Australians, Ms Brown is hanging out for an interest rate cut, however small. Cost-of-living pressures are being felt right across the world, and Australia is no different. How do our supermarket costs compare? She said the federal government could do more to help those who were struggling, like taking action on the rising cost of groceries and addressing concerns about the Coles and Woolworths duopoly. ""Here, where we live [locally], we've only got one of the big chains. We don't have another option,"" Ms Brown said. She is undecided on who will get her vote but said she would keep a close eye on policies likely to make a difference when it comes to cost of living.

She also lives in the electorate of Lyons and like many in the area is struggling with her mortgage repayments, which have increased by at least $200 a week in the last 12 to 15 months. ""My husband's at the point where he's working six days a week just to be able to live really,"" she said. Ms Carroll works four days a week. ""We're like middle-income earners … if we're feeling it I can only imagine how other families are feeling it,"" Ms Carroll said. The Senate inquiry into supermarket prices hears from people who forage for food in bins and from a farmer who says the major supermarkets' quality guidelines are ""almost impossible"" to meet. She said her house insurance has nearly doubled, and car insurance has also gone up. ""We only buy what we have to now, there's no nights out for dinner or anything like that,"" she said. She thinks politicians need to do more to help families thrive rather than survive. She said she'll be voting Liberal in the upcoming federal election. ""It just seems that they have a better understanding of how to manage money,"" she said. Ms Carroll is hopeful for a future where she and her husband don't have to work so hard and are able to enjoy their time off with their children. Kym Goodes, from 3P Advisory, says the cost of living is the primary concern for Tasmanian voters. (ABC News: Georgia Hogge) A survey of Tasmanians by advisory group 3P Advisory found a dominant aspiration for 2025 for many respondents was simply to survive. The figure that influences how high people's mortgage repayments are set has been 4.35 per cent since November 2023.  ""To be able to pay their rent, pay their mortgage, help put food on the table and get their kids to school in an environment economically — that is really tough to do that,"" 3P Advisory director Kym Goodes said. The survey found cost of living remained the area of top concern for Tasmanian voters, with healthcare next, followed by housing affordability. Forty-nine per cent of respondents were extremely or moderately concerned about interest rates. Ms Goodes said many Tasmanians were ""holding their breath"" for a Reserve Bank decision. There has been a big increase in community support for affordable housing, with 41 per cent in favour of planning decisions that ensure affordable housing is prioritised. Ms Goodes said voters wanted to see what levers governments could pull to make their lives easier.

What the PM left unsaid about his pre-election salmon intervention,Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's letter to salmon industry leaves much unanswered,2025-02-17 08:24:08,"The prime minister's latest salmon intervention has certainly been interpreted as a guarantee that salmon farming will continue in Macquarie Harbour. The reaction from Salmon Tasmania and West Coast mayor Shane Pitt showed that they think the fight is over after more than a year of uncertainty. ""It's great news that the prime minister has listened, listened to the science and he came out with the right outcome that we were hoping for,"" Cr Pitt said. West Coast mayor Shane Pitt has welcome the committment from the federal Labor government. (ABC News: Sandy Powell) But are Cr Pitt and the salmon industry right to be so convinced, and environmental groups so angry? Anthony Albanese has written to the salmon industry to confirm laws will be introduced that will protect salmon farms on Tasmania's west coast. The letter from Anthony Albanese to the salmon industry promises his government will introduce new legislation ""to ensure appropriate environmental laws are in place to continue sustainable salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour"". ""My commitment to you, your employees, suppliers and the community is that salmon farming operations on Macquarie Harbour will continue and that no jobs will be lost,"" Mr Albanese said in the letter, obtained by the ABC. But there are quite a few questions the letter doesn't answer. What will the legislation look like? When will it be in place? Tanya Plibersek is considering whether to review a 2012 decision to approve an expansion of salmon farming operations in Macquarie Harbour. (Supplied: Tassal) Will operations continue at current stocking levels? The letter only guarantees the continuance of ""sustainable"" salmon farming. What happens if there's another reduction in the numbers of endangered Maugean skate in the harbour? And what happens to the existing process where Federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek is still assessing whether to review salmon farming operations in the harbour?  Does the legislation override her decision if she comes to the conclusion that operations should be reviewed, or that more drastic steps — like a stocking density reduction or a stop to operations — is needed? What is clear is that the intervention was the prime minister's decision, not Ms Plibersek's. The Maugean Skate is only found in the wild in Macquarie Harbour, on Tasmania's west coast. (Supplied: Jane Ruckert) In his letter, Mr Albanese said he'd tasked his department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with working with the salmon industry ""to build an enduring partnership that can provide certainty for your operations in the harbour, your employees and their communities"". No mention of the environment department. A decision on whether to increase the threatened species listing of the Maugean skate, which shares its habitat with salmon-farming operations, won't be made until after next year's federal election. And a spokesperson for the environment minister referred questions about when the legislation would be in place to Mr Albanese. None of those unanswered questions blunted the enthusiasm of West Coast salmon workers. Petuna employee Tyrone Becker told the ABC yesterday that the company's social media platforms had gone ""crazy"" and he'd been bombarded with messages of support from community members, all pleased the period of uncertainty was over. Petuna worker Tyrone Becker says the announcement from the Prime Minister relieves a lot of uncertainty for the sector. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) The reaction from environmental groups and politicians who oppose salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour has been just as fierce, all seemingly resigned to the prime minister following through on his promise. Environmentalists have had a fierce reaction to the news, with concerns over the impact of salmon farming on the endangered Maugean Skate. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) But even though there's lots of water to go under the bridge before the promise becomes a reality, Mr Albanese's intervention means both major parties are on equal footing around salmon ahead of the federal election. With a similar lack of detail around Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's pledge to protect salmon industry jobs in Macquarie Harbour, Mr Albanese will be hoping his move is enough for pro-salmon voters to side with Labor, and win back the north-west electorate of Braddon. But will voters still blame him for the uncertainty that the community has gone through until now? Or will they think that Labor's Braddon candidate, current senator Anne Urquhart, holds enough sway to get her party to change position, and react favourably? The prime minister with Labor's Braddon candidate Anne Urquhart. (ABC News: Sandy Powell) And how big a role was salmon farming going to play in Braddon anyway if Mr Albanese didn't announce this policy change? We're yet to see any polling about how it compares to other key issues, such as cost of living pressures, but his repeated steps to assure the west coast community shows Labor powerbrokers think it's important. That's about all we know for sure from this announcement.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-17/tas-albanese-salmon-letter-analysis-macquarie-harbour/104943144
Albanese in trouble as polling shows Dutton most likely to be next PM,"Peter Dutton most likely to be next prime minister, according to YouGov poll",2025-02-16 09:51:17,"The Coalition would be in the best position to form government if an election was held today, according to a new estimate from pollster YouGov. The ABC can reveal the results of YouGov's latest MRP model, which finds the Peter Dutton-led Coalition would be likely to win about 73 seats, with a lower estimate of 65 and upper estimate of 80. A party needs 76 seats to govern in majority. The model estimates there is a 78 per cent chance of a hung parliament, and a 19 per cent chance of the Coalition winning a majority. The model is not a forecast of the election result, but it lays out where the imminent election campaign will be most hotly contested. It is based on a poll of 40,689 Australians, with the MRP, or multi-level regression with poststratification, modelling the survey's results across the demographics of all 150 electorates. It produces an estimate of the number of seats each party would win in parliament. The modelling indicates Labor would hold about 66 seats in the next parliament, with a lower estimate of 59 and an upper estimate of 72. Such a scenario would see Anthony Albanese trying to cobble together the support of nearly every crossbencher to continue as prime minister. Peter Dutton this morning told Sky News Australia that if the Coalition exceeded 72 seats and were ""a number of seats ahead of the Labor Party"", it would be ""unusual"" for crossbenchers not to offer his party confidence and supply. Independent Allegra Spender told the ABC's Insiders the absolute number of seats would be ""one of the factors"" in any supply decision she had to make, but that she would also consider who was best placed to deliver ""stable government"", affirming she would ""work with either party... depending on what they are actually going to put on the table"". The median result would see Labor lose 15 seats to the Coalition, including heartland seats such as Werriwa, which it has held for more than 90 years. In a sign Labor's optimism about gaining inner-Brisbane seats won by The Greens at the last election is not misplaced, the model suggests the party is on track to take back the seats of Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith, as well as potentially the seat of Fowler, currently held by independent Dai Le. All other independents are projected to retain their seats, and independents are competitive but trailing in Bradfield, Wannon and Cowper. Peter Dutton has been Leader of the Opposition since 2022. (ABC News: James Kelly) Independent gains in those seats would come at the expense of the Coalition. An MRP poll conducted by Redbridge and Accent Research with a smaller sample late last year also found the Coalition would likely win more seats than Labor. There is more uncertainty in seats with competitive independent and minor party candidates because their campaigns are more local and a candidate's profile is more influential in those races. A model using the same technique that YouGov published before the last election underestimated the support of independent and Greens candidates. Anthony Albanese is under pressure in outer-Sydney seats. (ABC News: Matthew Roberts) YouGov estimates Labor's current primary vote is at 29.1 per cent, which if replicated on polling day would be the party's lowest first-preference vote since Labor split in the 1930s. The poll puts independents and minor parties combined on just over 33 per cent of the vote, which would represent a small increase on the last election. Those vote share estimates are broadly consistent with other published opinion polling. The poll puts the Coalition on 51.1 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, compared to 48.9 per cent for Labor. That represents a swing 3.2 per cent swing since the last election. But the poll suggests that the swing against Labor is not uniform, and the government is facing the prospect of larger swings against it in the seats it holds, compared to the seats already held by the Coalition. The surveys were conducted between January 22 and February 12, and the national two-party-preferred figures have a margin of error of +/-0.5 per cent. Estimates for individual seats have a larger margin of error. YouGov's director of public data and affairs, Paul Smith, says the poll puts Mr Dutton in the ""box seat"" to become the next prime minister. ""What's very clear is that after this poll, the election is no longer a referendum on the government, but a choice between who will deliver best for working people,"" he says. The poll suggests that Labor's seat losses could include a swathe of seats in the outer regions of capital cities. ""There is no doubt that this election will be decided by working-class voters in outer Sydney and Melbourne and other parts of Australia who have been doing it tough with cost of living,"" Mr Smith says. New South Wales is shaping up as one of the fiercest election battlegrounds, being home to more than half of the seats YouGov predicts are likely to change. Bennelong is the only inner-Sydney seat that the model suggests will flip to the Coalition, but the Hunter region seats of Robertson, Paterson, and Shortland are all in play, along with Macquarie and Robertson closer to the city. In Melbourne, there appears to be a fierce battle underway for the marginal seat of Chisholm and the outer-north seat of McEwen. In Western Australia, the poll has Labor behind in Tangney, one of the four seats it gained at the last election, as well as the new seat of Bullwinkel. While the model is very unlikely to predict every seat correctly, its findings are broadly in line with other opinion polls in recent months and set the scene for an election campaign centred on cost-of-living issues. National polls have shown the government's support slowly falling since early 2023. MRP polls are used internally by political parties to help them craft campaign strategies and make spending decisions. There remains plenty of time for the landscape to shift, and all parties will be watching for an interest rate cut when the Reserve Bank meets this week. Global factors, including the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, could likewise up-end the political map. ""This is not so much a rejection of the government, but frustration with the current economic circumstances,"" Mr Smith says. ""Who actually steps up and says, 'I'm on the side of working people,' will be the winner of this election. ""It's all up for grabs and it's going to be a real contest between now and polling day."" Mr Albanese could visit the governor-general to call the election at any time, but it must be held by May 17.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-16/peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-election-polling/104941326
Labor takes out its trash ahead of election and Albanese couldn't be happier,Election funding legislation unifies major parties before they head to the polls,2025-02-15 04:00:00,"One of the great political traditions is how Friday is known as ""taking out the trash"" day. That is, if you have some bad, dodgy or unpalatable news that you are obliged to deal with, you release it in a flurry late on a Friday, when people are less likely to be paying attention. Australia's major political parties are not ones to hold with tradition though, it seems. This week we have seen them engage in a monumental ""taking out the trash"" moment by rushing through scandalously self-serving legislation on election funding on the second-last sitting day of the parliamentary calendar before either a budget, or an election, or possibly both. A positively buoyant prime minister was bouncing around Parliament House on Thursday looking more cheerful than he has in months, having landed hate crime laws, electoral funding changes, and childcare funding, prompting an outbreak of frenzied speculation that we are about to go to the polls. Beyond the legislative wins, the sense that — in the machismo of parliamentary Question Time — the government had actually finished the week on top, seemed to also be contributing to the PM's good mood. Why's that? Well, think about the stories that have been dominating the news in the past couple of weeks. There's the ongoing story of the cost of living of course. The Reserve Bank is widely expected to cut interest rates next week and, in political terms, the Coalition was on a hiding to nothing in attacking the government on the cost of living since Labor was able to simply point out all the cost-of-living relief the opposition had opposed. US President Donald Trump has unveiled a roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on every country that puts duties on US imports. (AP: Evan Vucci) Then there was the spectre of Donald Trump and his tariffs on steel and aluminium. The Coalition charged in with its usual assault on the PM: that he had been too weak and slow to head this off at the pass. But then there was a phone call with the US president which gave Anthony Albanese some breathing room on steel. It looked like the story was taking off again 24 hours later when US officials started to complain that Australia had breached undertakings on aluminium and would therefore still be penalised. When it became clear the breaches were based on verbal agreements apparently given to the US by former prime minister Scott Morrison, that also took some of the wind out of the Coalition's attack. And then there was the prospect of politically exploiting the horrendous video of NSW nurses threatening to, or claiming to, kill Jewish patients. Peter Dutton argued that such people should have their citizenship revoked and questioned how they had got it in the first place. Well, he should have known the answer to that question since it turned out the male nurse on whom his attack was based got his citizenship while Dutton was home affairs minister in 2020. Albanese was all smiles on Thursday after a productive sitting week.  (ABC News: Matthew Roberts) For once, in this parliament, it seemed the government was not just sitting like a hapless duck in the crosshairs of a Question Time attack. The psychology of these battles still matters in politics. But however bitter that battle it is, it can't beat the coming together of self-interest that we saw in the electoral donations legislation. The legislation was so rushed that parliamentarians were loudly complaining that they had not even seen the amendments being proposed while they were being debated. The major parties have agreed to more than double the donation threshold, ending a months-long stalemate to strike a deal that will infuriate the crossbench.  A lot of the focus in the coverage of this legislation — which will only affect federal elections after this year — has been on the caps on donations it puts into law which appear to wildly favour the major parties over independents. That focus is legitimate given how the legislation is structured — and some of the details that have only been emerging since it was passed through the Senate late on Wednesday night. But the ""uneven playing field"" of which the crossbench independents are complaining are literally only half the story (or possibly even less). ""This is the most transparent electoral reforms that have ever occurred in this country,"" Special Minister of State Senator Don Farrell primly opined on Thursday. ""And the whole process pushes downward pressure on the cost of elections so ordinary Australians have a chance to be elected, not just those candidates who are supported by the billionaires and the millionaires."" There's so much to unpack in those few sentences. Let's start with ""transparent electoral reforms"". On the positive side, there are indeed a couple of good bits of this legislation relating to the speed with which we will find out in future who has been donating to which political party or candidate. But as to the process of getting these laws through parliament, it was the complete opposite of ""transparent"". Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Then there is Farrell's declaration that ""the whole process pushes downward pressure on the cost of elections so ordinary Australians have a chance to be elected, not just those candidates who are supported by the billionaires and the millionaires"". Really? There was a splendid moment of political jousting on this when Farrell ran into independent MP Zali Steggall in the press gallery on Thursday morning. ""A 47 per cent increase in how much the public will pay politicians per vote,"" she responded to Farrell's declarations. ""A 47 per cent increase. Think about that,"" she proclaimed for the cameras. Steggall was talking about another part of the legislative package: a deal on public funding, not just for election campaigns, but for political parties. Members of the crossbench have recorded a surge in donations as the two major parties rammed through changes to limit the amount politicians and candidates can spend. Taxpayers fund political campaigns by reimbursing successful candidates per vote. Currently, they receive $3.39 per vote. Under the new laws that will go up to $5 a vote. But in addition to that, political parties receive taxpayer funding for ""administration"" costs. The Centre for Public Integrity estimated that in the financial year leading up to the last election, political parties received $67.8 million in public funding. Based on that number, the cost of public funding to political parties is about to rise to at least $100 million, and on some estimates as much as $140 million to $150 million over the next few years. So much for Farrell's ""downward pressure on the cost of elections"". The government and opposition would claim that the other arm of the cost of elections — the so-called ""arms race"" in political donations from private individuals and organisations — has also been dealt with via the caps put on donations. Except the caps looks more like the top of a salt and pepper shaker. The $50,000 cap on individual donations each year looks reasonable to start with. Except an individual donor could make that donation to each division of a major political party to top their donations up to $450,000. What's more, the Liberal Party, for example, also has around 83 ""associated entities"" which gives some idea of how a lot more money could easily be funnelled through the system. Both Farrell and his equivalent high-minded counterpart in the Coalition — Senator James McGrath — both dismissed the independents' outrage at an $800,000 spending cap being put on individual candidates when political parties have a $90 million overall cap, within which they can funnel resources into particular seats. ""As a former campaign director [for the LNP] I can say to the teals"", McGrath told the Senate, ""if they can't get their message out in a seat with 800,000 dollars, then they need to look at their message or they need to look at what they are spending that money on"". Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Really? Figures compiled by the Australia Institute recently showed the average spend per House of Representatives candidate in the 2021 election was just under $800,000 for Labor, just over $800,000 for the Coalition and just over $600,000 for community independents. And those are average figures. Imagine what might have been spent in the hotly contested marginal seats, or seats like Kooyong in 2022 where the treasurer of the day, and possible heir apparent to the leadership, Josh Frydenberg, was facing what would be a stunning defeat at the hands of Monique Ryan. The caravan is going to move on rapidly from this story as election fever takes hold. But there is still plenty of rich pickings to be had when we go through the trash.

PM heckled as wind farms remain key battleground in Labor heartland,Anti-offshore wind campaigners heckle PM at Illawarra candidate announcement,2025-02-14 16:26:38,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has had a blunt reminder of one of the key issues plaguing Labor in its coastal heartland. In the wake of Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones's sudden retirement from politics, Mr Albanese travelled to the New South Wales Illawarra to unveil who his government hopes will take his place as the Member for Whitlam. But announcement of Carol Berry as Labor's new candidate did not go to plan. Mr Albanese was greeted by half a dozen protesters who vented their frustration at the government's offshore wind plans.  Hecklers repeatedly interrupted his press conference shouting ""we don't want your wind farms"" and calling for the prime minister to put the turbines ""in front of your mansion on the water"". Hecklers interrupted the prime minister's press conference. (ABC News) Mr Albanese briefly engaged with the protesters, claiming the criticisms were from the opposition's playbook.  ""You can see behind me here there is a group of Labor party supporters and there is a small [group] of Labor party opponents,"" Mr Albanese said. Offshore wind has remained a politically charged topic along Australia's coast, particularly in the Illawarra and Hunter regions where the opposition has vowed to scrap offshore wind zones and the debate has turned volatile.  The prime minister's press conference on Friday was held at the same reserve where seven months ago former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce called for voters to use their votes as bullets to ""say goodbye"" to the prime minister. Alex O'Brien is one of the people who heckled the prime minister. (ABC Illawara: Nicole Curby) Anti-offshore wind campaigner Alex O'Brien was one of the organisers of that rally and was also among the hecklers on Friday. ""Our group came down here because we heard the prime minister was going to be here and the Labor party has declined the opportunity to speak to our community about the offshore wind farm,"" he said. ""We're concerned about local jobs in fishing and tourism and that's why we're here today."" The southern parts of the Illawarra have been held by Labor for almost a century. But with a popular local member stepping down, the offshore wind issue will be something the incoming Labor candidate will have to navigate in the lead up to this year's poll.   Carol Berry has been picked to replace Stephen Jones in the seat of Whitlam. (ABC Illawarra: Nicole Curby) Carol Berry was most recently the chief executive of large disability services provider The Disability Trust and has previously worked in domestic violence support and as a lawyer.    But this is not her first foray into politics. She ran as the Greens candidate at the 2001 federal election in the Wollongong seat of Cunningham. When Micheal Organ ended Labor's 49-year stranglehold on the Wollongong seat, Ms Berry was his advisor and she was also the party's national secretary. The prime minister defended Ms Berry's history with the Greens, claiming she joined the party when she was ""very young"" before switching allegiances.  ""She has been a member of the Labor party for over 20 years,"" Mr Albanese said. ""If you are serious about change, the Labor party is the vehicle which as a party of government promotes that change."" Mr Jones (centre) is meeting community members with Ms Berry (centre left). (Supplied: Facebook) Ms Berry is not the only defector to a major party running in Whitlam. The Liberal party has pre-selected Ben Britton who was part of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP) in his failed bid for Cunningham in 2022.

The army veteran and cyber security expert recently failed in his attempt to secure pre-selection for the party in former prime minister Scott Morrison's seat of Cook. Anthony Albanese visits steelworkers at Port Kembla. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss) The prime minister also visited the Port Kembla steelworks for the first time since United States President Donald Trump announced tariffs on all steel imports. BlueScope Steel is by far Australia's largest steel exporter to the US and Mr Albanese had a simple message for local steelworkers. ""My message is very clear: we've got your back,"" said Mr Albanese. Mr Trump signed an executive order on Friday morning confirming his administration would be implementing reciprocal tariffs on all nations.  ""We continue to put forward our case which is a very simple one,"" said Mr Albanese. ""Australia has zero tariffs on US goods coming into Australia.""

Candidate's push for SA's largest seat turns contest into two-horse race,Independent candidate Anita Kuss joins race for federal seat of Grey,2025-02-14 16:24:56,"South Australia's largest seat so far only has two candidates as a federal election nears. With Liberal incumbent Rowan Ramsey declaring his retirement last March, the party was quick to announce Tom Venning as its candidate for the federal seat of Grey. Mr Venning, the nephew of former long-serving Liberal politician Ivan Venning, has been campaigning against no one for five months, with a second contender only just announced. Anita Kuss, chief executive of regional education provider UniHub Spencer Gulf and Crystal Brook local, will contest as an independent candidate. The Labor party and the Greens have yet to announce their candidates for Grey, which covers more than 92 per cent of South Australia including the Mid North, Far North, Eyre Peninsula and Yorke Peninsula. Tom Venning is the Liberal candidate for Grey. (Supplied: SA Liberals) Speaking outside Port Pirie council chambers on Friday, Ms Kuss said she would be running ""a grassroots campaign from here in the region"". ""What we've heard really strongly in the lead up to this campaign over the last six months is that people are really ready for politics to be done differently in this community, and I think people are ready for change,"" Ms Kuss said. ""To be honest, I wouldn't have put my hand up to contest the seat as an independent member if it wasn't for the huge groundswell of support right across this region. ""We have been really fortunate to receive some support through Climate 200."" Anita Kuss made the announcement with supporters including Geoff Brock (right). (ABC North and West: Viki Ntafillis) Ms Kuss, who grew up in Clare, said she had lived and worked around the electorate, including in advocacy, local government and natural resource management groups. She said the Whyalla community, which faced a uncertain future with woes from the local steelworks, would benefit from an independent voice in federal parliament. ""Our hearts are breaking for Whyalla at the moment, but to be honest, it's not the first time that this has happened, and it won't be the last time until things change,"" Ms Kuss said. If successful, she would be the first member for Grey who was an independent and a woman. ",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/anita-kuss-independent-candidate-grey-federal-election/104936698
Independent records most donations in a single day after spending caps pass,Spike in donations to independents after election spending caps pass parliament,2025-02-14 13:55:48,"Independent candidates have recorded a surge in donations as the two major parties rammed through changes to limit the amount politicians and candidates can spend, with one even recording the biggest number of individual donations in a single day. Allegra Spender, Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel and David Pocock all saw donations to their campaigns climb in the last week, as they together expressed outrage at the government's electoral reforms. The government argues the changes, which will cap political donations and election expenditure for the first time, will ""level the playing field"" and take big money out of politics. Under the new rules, which passed parliament on Thursday morning but will not take effect until after this year's election, single candidates will be barred from spending more than $800,000. Special minister of state Don Farrell spearheaded the electoral rules reform.  (ABC News: Matt Roberts) But a party can spend up to $90 million nationally, sparking fury from the crossbench who have accused the major parties of trying to shore up their own power in the face of challenges from independents. Donations publicly disclosed on Ms Chaney's website show on Thursday she received her highest-ever number of donations in a single day, with 63 people gifting between $10 and $1,000 each. ""It's no surprise that we've seen a surge in donations since the electoral reform bill passed,"" Ms Chaney said. ""People can see this for what it is — a blatant power grab — and they're not happy about it."" Ms Spender also said her campaign had received a ""very significant uptick"" of nearly 300 ""small donations"" in the last week, which she flatly attributed to voter discontent about the major parties doing a deal to dramatically change electoral laws. To put that in perspective, it's nearly half the number of total donors that contributed to her entire 2022 campaign, in just one week. Indi MP Helen Haines, who could become a kingmaker if the federal election returns a hung parliament, will make unpicking a deal struck by Labor and the Coalition on political donations a key negotiating point for her support. ""They're angry and I think that's why they've made all these donations,"" the Wentworth MP said. ""It really shows I think how much people are engaged on this issue and how angry they are at the government and the opposition."" She said the legislation's rushed passage through parliament didn't sit well with voters. ""When Australians are facing all sorts of issues, to rush through donation laws that just benefit the major parties I think is of real concern to people,"" she said. ""Australians clearly don't want to see the major parties lock in their cosy duopoly and lockout healthy competition."" In the past day, Ms Daniel said she also received a boost from constituents worth thousands of dollars. ""I was out on the streets of my electorate this morning and people were literally stopping to tell me how pissed off they are at the dirty deal that Labor and the Liberals have done on campaign finance,"" she said. The ABC understands some of the independents generated the donation rise through social media posts and emailing supporters. ACT senator David Pocock pointed out that a party could spend much more than an independent so long as they did not mention the candidate's name. Those criticisms coincided with a spike in donations to his campaign, too. His team told ABC News more than 1,000 donations have been made to his 2025 campaign so far, with a 400 per cent increase this week compared to last. ""This week we saw the major parties once again team up to put their self-interest ahead of the best interests of people in the community and that has absolutely energised communities around the country looking for a different, better way of doing politics,"" he said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/independents-donation-spike-electoral-reform/104937430
Albanese's Question Time 'valedictory' lap points to March or April election,"Albanese drops hints galore in Question Time 'valedictory' lap, pointing to March or April election",2025-02-13 18:20:12,"The prime minister has hinted parliament will not return after Thursday, all but killing off prospects of a March budget and paving the way for an election between mid-next month and early April. A buoyant Anthony Albanese, cheered by a flurry of last-minute legislative wins on child care and electoral funding reform, believes his government has had a successful fortnight in Question Time. The last two weeks have seen the government cut deals with the Greens and crossbench on production tax credits, childcare access and anti-hate laws, while also clearing political ""barnacles"" by dumping stranded legislation including nature positive reforms. A looming election campaign elevates the importance of Tuesday's Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate meeting. Economists widely anticipate the first cash rate cut in four years, providing the government with a potential springboard to claim the fight against inflation is working. Mr Albanese triggered a minor flurry of speculation about poll dates after being spotted visiting the Canberra Press Gallery, located in the top floor of the Senate wing. He is understood to have toured several newsrooms, something the prime minister has not done since winning the job in May 2022. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said his party would get the country ""back on track"" if it wins the coming election. This week has seen several hints that the last fortnight's sittings are the last for this parliament. When one of Mr Albanese's backbenchers — a near two-decade veteran of the parliament — was ejected from Question Time, the prime minister exclaimed: ""on his last day!"" Labor sources noted Mr Dutton did not ask a single question during Question Time, even though there was a widespread belief among MPs that it was the final session before an election. If the strong hints that Thursday was the final sitting day of the parliament are correct, an election could be called as early as Sunday and as late as March 23, two days before the budget is slated. Parliament is currently due to return on February 23 for a Senate-only estimates week, according to the official calendar. Those dates mean an election might fall as early as March 22 and as late — given the Easter holidays — as April 12. However, if Mr Albanese decides to hang on as long as possible, calling an election after the Easter break, he can wait until May 17. That would mean bringing parliament back for a budget. During a boisterous final Question Time of the parliamentary sitting fortnight, Labor MPs dropped several hints that a May election is off the table. Brian Mitchell, a retiring Labor Tasmanian MP, stood to ask what he described as ""my last question in this place"". At the same time, Mr Albanese sharpened his political attack lines, telling the chamber that Labor is ""delivering on the cost of living"" while the Coalition is more focused on meal and entertainment tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses. ""They only care about their mates' cost of lunching,"" he said. Mr Dutton was equally forthright, accusing the prime minister and government of ""living in a parallel universe"" to ordinary Australians. ""We will clean up this government's mess and we will get our country back on track.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-13/albanese-hints-march-april-election/104934392
"As the PM served canapes, The Godfather was back in parliament",Don Farrell's press conference turned pantomime as MPs up the theatrics,2025-02-13 16:33:59,"Welcome back to your weekly federal politics update, where Brett Worthington gets you up to speed on the happenings from Parliament House. It was a Bill Clinton advisor who famously dubbed politics as being show business for ugly people.  Going off the last fortnight in Canberra, it's often felt that the performance art being offered up looks more like something from a community theatre than anything you'd see in Hollywood. With the whiff of an election in the air, there's been no shortage of ham acting on show. Enter Don Farrell, the South Australian factional heavyweight often dubbed The Godfather, a man frantically trying to prevent Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Australian exports.  Farrell is the ultimate backroom man, a powerbroker second to none when it comes to counting numbers.  That's not to suggest he's too shy to stand in front of the cameras, which is where he found himself on Thursday morning to talk up an eleventh-hour deal struck with the Coalition to overhaul electoral donation laws. Crossbenchers have dubbed the new laws, which cap individual donations and the amount candidates and parties can spend, as a dirty deal struck between two parties in a political duopoly fearing their grip on power is under threat from independent candidates. David Pocock joined with crossbench MPs to slam the deal Labor and the Coalition struck over political donations. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson) Enter stage right, Zali Steggall, the OG teal independent-cum-journalist (at least for a couple of minutes on Thursday morning).  Like an enthusiastic audience at a Christmas panto, the journalists present had to offer a version of SHE'S BEHIND YOU as the Warringah MP took her place alongside the minister.  Like all well trained politicians in media performing, Farrell kept his eyes locked on the cameras as Steggall lobbed question after question his way.  A couple of nights earlier, the PM had extended a first-of-term invite to Steggall and fellow her fellow crossbenchers for evening drinks at his Canberra residence.  Add in his chats with Bob Katter in north Queensland last week and you could be forgiven for thinking this was a prime minister suddenly realising he might need some friends on the crossbench if the polls prove correct. Australians could head to the polls in a federal election within months. So when will it be and what are the key seats in the battle to lead the country? At the same time the PM was serving canapes, The Godfather was back at parliament stitching up a deal with the Coalition. An irate Steggall on Thursday told journalists the crossbench had learned about the deal via the media, so she had no qualms making her frustrations with the minister clear with him in front of the cameras. Farrell and his numbers won the day. Steggall, however, insists she'll be remembering if they come knocking after the election.  ""That is the height of insult, and that doesn't bode well for having to work with an Albanese-led government in minority situation,"" she told RN Breakfast.  Next Tuesday will prove crucial in when the PM decides to call an election. If the Reserve Bank cuts rates on Tuesday, Liberals are preparing for him to head to see the Governor-General as early as next Friday.  (A timely reminder that no one besides Albanese actually knows when the election will be).  But even without the starting gun being fired, the race is well and truly under way. Just this week, Labor was busy governing. It announced half a billion dollars for women's health, got the banks to agree to keep their regional branches open for at least two years, relaxed home loan lending rules for people with student debt and pledged to take ownership of the regional airline Rex if a private buyer doesn't stump up. It's also finally released the $2.2 billion it promised for Victoria ahead of the last election for a contentious suburban rail project (a rare piece of good news for a state Labor government still licking its wounds after a bruising by-election at the weekend that has sent terror through its federal counterparts). As polling day approaches, there's been a noticeable shift in Labor's campaigning, with Queensland cabinet minister Anika Wells leading the way on social media posts.   Both sides of politics have been sharpening their online messages and throwing convention out the window in the online effort to win voters.  But with boundaries being pushed, Labor was again reminded this week that old school rules of truth still apply. The party put out a misleading video of Peter Dutton, in which it selectively edited comments he made a decade ago. An attack ad posted by Labor (left) compared to the original broadcast from 2014 shows how the former was edited. (ABC News) The Nationals too found themselves in electoral advertising hot water. Victorian MP Anne Webster, who represents the geographically large seat of Mallee in north west Victoria, has rented an office she plans to keep empty so she can plaster it with posters.  Webster insists she's done nothing wrong. ""Because we're going into a federal election, it just seems useful to have at least what I would be paying for in a billboard on an office front,""  she told the ABC.  Some political experts claim the tax-payer funded empty office is deceptive and could breach rules, assertions Webster rejects. Anne Webster is under fire after leasing an empty office in Horsham Speaking of the Nats, Thursday morning brought with it quite the parliamentary scuttlebutt. Barnaby Joyce is resigning! Jacinta Nampijinpa Price is moving from the NT to take his seat of New England! Remember! She was in Tamworth for Australia Day, it was noted, a scene broadcast on this week's Australian Story on the senator, as if to suggest evidence of the impending move. Rumours have long surrounded a possible moveo to the lower house for Jacinta Nampijinpa-Price. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) As is so often the case with rumours in parliament, it wasn't to be, with Joyce affirming his plans to seek re-election.  It's not the first time Price has been linked to a Lower House move.  After the Voice referendum, the Jacinta for PM calls had her name being touted as a possible replacement for Liberals Scott Morrison in Cook and Warren Entsch in the far north Queensland seat of Leichhardt.  You get the sense it won't be the last time Price will be linked to a move to the Lower House. For a few days, it was looking like former ABC chair Ita Buttrose was going to take home the week's hot mic prize. Appearing in the Federal Court in the case between the national broadcaster and journalist Antoinette Lattouf, she was in no mood for the lines of questions she was facing. Muttering ""Jesus Christ"" and reportedly rolling her eyes, a hot mic broadcast Buttrose's words not just throughout the court but to all watching the live broadcast.  Back in parliament, she wasn't to be outdone. Sitting in the president's chair, Queenslander James McGrath was overseeing the Senate and (seemingly) let out a noise that needs to be heard to be believed.  Senator James McGrath's audible belch while in Senate President's chair Whether it was a burp or a groan, it had more end of year late night vibes than the first sitting of the parliamentary year.  It was almost three years to the day, in the dying days of the Morrison government, that the Coalition found itself getting splintered from its own political wedge. The Coalition's push to frame Labor as anti-religion came in the form of a religious discrimination legislation, which if enacted would have allowed religious schools to expel transgender students.  Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Five of the Coalition's own MPs couldn't stomach it and crossed the floor, in an emotion-charged early morning vote that delivered the government an embarrassing defeat.  Fast forward to the dying days of this parliament and issues surrounding transgender children were again suddenly on the agenda, in the form of a Pauline Hanson proposal for a Senate healthcare inquiry.  The proposal was voted down but had the support of most Coalition senators, something Dutton was in no mood to talk about when he fronted a press conference earlier this week.  Continuing to highlight Labor's past critique of Donald Trump carries political risk for the Coalition. Not least because it ignores what's really driving those encouraging Trump to apply tariffs to Australia. Dutton insisted senators were allowed a conscience vote on ""that issue"" and refused to say if he supported it.  Liberal Andrew Bragg split from his colleagues and voted against the inquiry. Speaking afterwards to the ABC's Afternoon Briefing, he said he was worried trans people were being targeted for political gain.  ""I think some people see this as an opportunity to tee off on a minority group, to try and build up a particular following and I think that is very dangerous,"" he said.  Just last week, Nine newspapers reported Dutton had made clear to his shadow cabinet they were to focus on inflation and not distracting personal agendas. Not to be outdone, Canberra's other parliament also isn't too shy for a a theatrical performance.  It started out rather seriously.  Canberra Liberal Peter Cain wanted to know why minister Marisa Paterson had not been made aware about a fine being imposed on a venue following the death of a patron. The minister insisted privacy laws prevented its disclosure.  What came next was pretty standard politics.  Peter Cain: Minister, aren’t you, really, just throwing your regulator under the bus?  Marisa Paterson: No. I am demonstrating that the regulator is upholding the laws of the ACT.  Enter newly elected Liberal Deborah Morris, who wondered: ""Minister, what else aren’t you being told about?"" After a pregnant pause a bemused minister replied: ""I don't know."" If politics is show business for ugly people, Canberra certainly ain't Hollywood.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-13/don-farrell-zali-steggall-election-donation-laws-dutton/104927966
Independent Haines will seek to undo electoral reform in hung parliament,Helen Haines says unpicking electoral reform a key negotiating point under possible hung parliament,2025-02-13 05:00:22,"Independent MP Helen Haines, who could become a kingmaker if the federal election returns a hung parliament, will make unpicking a deal struck by Labor and the Coalition on political donations a key negotiating point for her support. With the final full sitting fortnight of parliament drawing to a close, the major parties landed on a deal to cap individual donations at $50,000, or an effective $450,000 for parties with branches in every state and territory. The donations reforms will also create a lower minimum threshold for disclosing donations, set up provision for real-time donation disclosures and cap total national spending by a party at $90 million.  Senior Labor sources described the bill as the biggest suite of electoral reforms in four decades that would help curb the political influence of billionaires on Australian democracy. But independent crossbenchers, who will prove crucial to the major parties if neither can win a majority of seats, say the bill entrenches a lack of transparency within politics.  With polling suggesting a hung parliament is likely, the ABC asked Ms Haines whether the last-hour reform deal would influence who she would support in a minority government. Ms Haines said it would play a role, and she would prioritise its reform. ""Let’s be clear, both the Coalition and the Labor Party are a unity ticket on trying to dupe our democracy into voting for the major parties, so they're as bad as each other on this,"" Ms Haines said.  ""I've been a champion for transparency and integrity and politics from the day I came here and throughout.  ""If I'm fortunate enough to be re-elected into the next federal parliament, this so-called electoral reform will be well and truly in my line of sight to reform.” Ms Haines, whose seat of Indi has been held by an independent since 2013, is deeply critical of the deal struck yesterday, which watered down some donations thresholds. She and other independents have claimed the structure of the donations caps benefits major party campaigns and disadvantages individual candidate campaigns, and do not sufficiently address money raised through fundraising dinners or membership fees. The donations reform deal struck between the major parties prompted a furious response from independent MPs and senators. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson) Independent senator David Pocock said the major parties had left loopholes in the laws that benefited them. ""At an electorate level there's an $800,000 spending cap per candidate … but then on top of that the party can basically spend an unlimited amount on party advertising, so as long as they don't mention that candidate's name there really is no cap up to the $90 million spending cap per party,"" Senator Pocock said. ""They have also decided not to include in their caps all the people that help organise elections, who you would think are part of an election, [like] all the administrators organising events."" With the reforms one of the likely last acts of this parliament, Senator Pocock said it was ""pretty telling"" that going into an election ""the major parties' number one priority is themselves"". Ms Haines says she will push to rewrite the reforms as a matter of urgency in the next term of parliament. ""I absolutely support taking big money out of politics and out of our democracy but what this bill does is entrench a problem with a lack of transparency and entrenches a major party advantage over any new players,"" Ms Haines said.  ""It’s clearly unfair. The Australian public will see through this, I hope they do they need to vote with their feet on this and say we’re not having it.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-13/helen-haines-political-donations-reform-minority/104929724
Former Tasmanian Labor leader quits state politics to focus on federal bid,Former Tasmanian Labor leader Rebecca White steps down as state MP to focus on federal tilt in key seat,2025-02-12 14:24:32,"Former Tasmanian Labor leader Rebecca White has announced she has quit state parliament in a bid to retain the marginal seat of Lyons for Labor in this year's federal election. Ms White, who led Tasmanian Labor from 2017 to 2024, was last November preselected for the federal seat, to replace incumbent Brian Mitchell. But she has continued to be a state MP, until now. Rebecca White is hoping to become a federal Labor MP at the next election. (ABC News: Maren Preuss) On Wednesday, Ms White said she had written to the governor to resign, effective from today. Ms White had originally signalled she would resign from state parliament once the federal election date was called. However, no date has been set for the election and state parliament was due to return on March 4. ""I think it's really important for the state team to have certainty about who's representing this state seat in parliament when they return on the 4th of March. ""It makes sense now for me to announce my intention."" Ms White said it had been the ""honour of her life"" to serve in state parliament, but she was now focused on dedicating herself full time to representing her community at a federal level. ""I am seeking to represent exactly the same people who've elected me election after election, and hopefully represent them in Canberra,"" Ms White said. After three election defeats, Rebecca White resigns as Tasmanian Labor leader. It could prompt a battle between the party's left and right factions to decide on the next leader. Ms White entered state parliament in 2010 as a 27-year-old, polled strongly in the 2014 state election and became Labor Party leader in 2017 following the resignation of Bryan Green. She briefly resigned as leader in 2021 following state Labor's election loss, making way for now-independent MP David O'Byrne to lead the party. Mr O'Byrne held the position for 22 days before resigning following allegations of sexual harassment. Ms White was then picked by the party caucus to lead Labor again. She has led Tasmanian Labor to three state election losses in 2018, 2021 and 2024 and stepped down as party leader last March. ""Of course, I would have loved to have been a part of a Labor government here in Tasmania,"" Ms White said. Mr Albanese has turned to Ms White to hold onto the marginal federal seat, which was only won by outgoing Labor member Brian Mitchell by just over 1,300 votes in the 2022 election. Ms White will be up against Liberal Susie Bower, who saw a 4.2 per cent swing in her favour last election. ""This is a very tight race,"" Ms White conceded. Election analyst Kevin Bonham said Ms White has an advantage against Ms Bower of being well-known within the electorate. ""She has the advantage that she's been the state MP for the seat for 14 years, including half of that time as opposition leader,"" Mr Bonham said. ""She has a ready-made profile in the area. ""But she does still have to build awareness that she's running as a federal candidate and what she wants to do as a federal candidate."" He said Ms White's replacement at state level would most likely be one of the unsuccessful Labor candidates from last year's state election — Richard Goss, Ben Dudman, Casey Farrell, Carole McQueeney or Edwin Batt. But he said the recount was ""unusual"". ""Often there's an obvious front-runner,"" Mr Bonham said. ""In this case, Ben Dudman has a bit of an edge on the votes that we know about, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he will win. Tasmanian Electoral Commissioner Andrew Hawkey said the results of the recount may not be known when Tasmania’s House of Assembly sits on March 4.

A grade 6 class from St Francis of Assisi School in Canberra was given 30 minutes to ask Anthony Albanese anything they wanted at a press conference at Parliament House, organised by children's TV news program BTN.  The students came up with their own questions, and negotiated the final list among themselves. ""It was challenging, because [you worry] the prime minister could maybe get offended — some of the questions are bit personal,"" student Jennifer said. Between the hard-hitting questions, student Rory said they ""tried to squeeze in some funny ones"". Rory wanted to ask a mix of serious and lighter questions. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) BTN contacted opposition leader Peter Dutton requesting an interview, but did not receive a response. Here's a selection of what the students most wanted to know. Several students had raised concerns about housing policy ahead of the press conference. ""That's a big one, because I don't want to be homeless,"" Rory said. Mr Albanese said there was ""no short-term fix"" to housing shortages, and breaking into the market was ""harder for younger generations"". He may be the leader of Australia, but Anthony Albanese missed out on leadership positions in school. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) ""The key to housing policy is supply,"" he said. ""We've got an objective of 1.2 million homes to be built over this decade that we're in now.  ""We think that will be really important to give you the opportunity to buy a home."" The fact that ""there are only 24 hours in the day"", according to Mr Albanese. ""I have such a busy schedule, so I wish sometimes I had more time,"" he said. Mr Albanese said Australia would have a ""constructive relationship"" with the United States. ""I had a very good conversation with President Trump after he got elected,"" he said. ""We're different countries, and so we have different political systems, and we have our own Australian values as well."" Mr Albanese says the government will work constructively with US President Donald Trump. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) He said Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the United Nations' Paris Climate Agreement, and remove funding from international aid organisations, would not influence Australia. ""We will make sure that we make our own decisions there,"" Mr Albanese said. This one was a sensitive topic for the prime minister. ""I didn't get to be a school or house captain. That's a very raw thing that you've raised,"" he told the students. ""I wasn't even allowed to be a prefect.  ""[I'm] not quite sure why that was the case."" Mr Albanese said that question was better suited to Peter Dutton, who wants to build nuclear reactors around Australia if elected. ""I am not a supporter of nuclear energy in Australia,"" Mr Albanese said. The Coalition wants to build nuclear power plants in Australia if it wins office. (Four Corners: Ryan Sheridan) ""I want to get on with what we are doing, because our coal-fired power stations are reaching the end of their life.  ""Renewables and gas is, I think, the way to go.""  Watching sport, including rugby league and AFL, and walking the dog rated a mention. ""My dog, Toto, she takes up a bit of time,"" Mr Albanese said. Anthony Albanese and his dog Toto at The Lodge. (AAP: Mick Tsikas) ""When I was your age, I used to collect stamps … and I also collected footy cards.  ""When I was elected prime minister, you have to move to The Lodge here in Canberra, so I found a shoebox full of all the sets of footy cards that I had … going back to the 1970s when I was at school."" The prime minister commended the students for their interest in the environment. ""Young people I find are much more conscious about the environment than my generation was,"" he said. ""I think how young people can help is to remind your parents and others who are older than you of what your values are and why it's important that all of us are responsible."" The students put a lot of thought into their questions. (Supplied: Catholic Education Department) Mr Albanese told the students both the federal government and opposition supported a two-state solution to the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""It's not easy, and no-one should think it's easy, but the alternative is devastating — to think that you could just have ongoing conflict,"" he said. ""We need a breakthrough."" He also said Australia needed to ""play a constructive role to oppose the actions of terrorists"". The prime minister faced some tough questions from the children. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Associate Professor Faith Gordon from the ANU College of Law said she was not surprised by the students' willingness to tackle heavy topics, as young generations were ""extremely engaged"" in world affairs.

""They feel part of an international movement on these issues,"" she said. ""Through research that I've done, I know that young people are extremely articulate … and they actually want the politicians to find solutions to address these issues.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-12/primary-school-students-quiz-prime-minister-youth-politics/104917580
Labor accused of 'disinformation' with misleading Dutton ad,Labor accused of reigniting 'Mediscare' campaign with misleading video of Peter Dutton,2025-02-12 05:19:44,"Labor has been accused of reigniting its ""Mediscare"" campaign ahead of the federal election with a misleadingly edited attack ad in which Opposition Leader Peter Dutton declares ""Medicare is dead"". The edited video was authorised by Labor's head office and shared by several of the party's social media accounts, including as a paid ad on Facebook. It shows Mr Dutton appearing to call for an end to free health care. ""We've said and we're very clear about this: Medicare is dead,"" Mr Dutton says in the video. ""They can't be for free. We have to pay for a world-class medical system."" However, this was not his full statement. The ABC has located the original footage, posted 10 years ago on YouTube. Do you know more? Help us uncover the hidden campaign this election. It was from a November 2014 press conference broadcast on the ABC when Mr Dutton was the health minister in the Abbott government. He was defending plans to introduce a co-payment for bulk-billed medical consultations. His full quote, in response to a reporter's question about whether the co-payment plan would be dumped because of crossbench opposition, was as follows: ""We're very clear about this. Medicare is dead if we can't make it sustainable today. The Labor Party will kill Medicare by offering everything to everybody for free and the government is determined to make Medicare sustainable [and] strong, not just for today, these are plans that will set up Medicare for the next decade or two. We have had good feedback, good engagement with the independent senators. But we are pragmatic about this Senate, but we are absolutely determined to make Medicare sustainable. So, the Labor Party can pretend to the Australian public that things are for free, they can't be for free, we have to pay for a world-class medical system."" A comparison of Labor's edited attack ad and that section of the press conference is below. An attack ad posted by Labor (left) compared to the original broadcast from 2014 shows how the former was edited. (ABC News) The Abbott government abandoned the co-payment plan in 2015. This edited video has attracted nearly 200,000 views across Labor's Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Linkedin accounts. It also received nearly 2,000 likes and hundreds of comments. Versions of it have been shared on the social media accounts of Multicultural Affairs Minister Julian Hill and Labor candidate Ali France. Ms France is running in a tight race against Mr Dutton in his Queensland seat of Dickson. She reposted it on her TikTok and Instagram with the caption: ""The guy who wants to be Prime Minster said 'Medicare is dead'."" Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic also published the video as a paid ad on Facebook and Instagram on January 29. According to Meta's Ad Library data, it reached about 25,000 to 35,000 users and was targeted predominantly at men aged 35 to 45. The ABC found another edited version of the press conference with Mr Dutton published in Labor fundraising communications. A mass email sent from Health and Aged Care Minister Mark Butler's office included a GIF of Mr Dutton stating: ""Medicare will not survive in the long term."" Ali France (left) is running against the opposition leader in the seat of Dickson in Queensland. (AAP: Darren England) Mr Husic and Ms France did not respond to requests for comment. The ABC understands individual Labor MPs and candidates were not involved in the creation of the video, which was produced by the party's headquarters. Labor national secretary Paul Erickson did not respond to specific questions about the posts but said the party would be ""reminding Australians of Peter Dutton's record, and on-the-record remarks, every single day until the election"". However, it is understood Labor plans to remove the posts after the Liberal Party complained to the ABC about the use of its content. The ABC then approached Labor with a request to take down the posts. The ABC does not allow political parties to use its content in campaign materials in order to preserve its independence. No system is 100 per cent secure, but the Signal app can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions of the app to work out if it is the best method of communication for you. Political communication expert Andrew Hughes from the Australian National University said he believed Labor's video was disinformation, designed to mislead voters about Mr Dutton's position on Medicare. ""They're trying to create fear,"" Dr Hughes said. ""That fear aspect has worked so well for them before on this issue, particularly in 2016 when 'Mediscare' was the hallmark of that election campaign."" That campaign culminated in an election-eve SMS campaign that claimed prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was seeking to privatise Medicare, a claim that Mr Turnbull described as ""an extraordinary act of dishonesty"". In December last year, Treasurer Jim Chalmers claimed Peter Dutton would ""come after Medicare"". Labor's official social media accounts have been posting regularly about Medicare in recent months, which Dr Hughes sees as a sign it is reviving its attacks on the Coalition over public health care this election campaign. The outcome of two misleading assertions in 2022 reinforces what many in Australia have long suspected — that when it comes to the facts, there is one set of rules for politicians and another for everyone else. He believes Labor is targeting its latest campaign at younger men because some recent polls have shown the opposition is growing in popularity among that group of voters. ""By the Labor Party doing this … they're giving the green light to everybody else to do it in the campaign as well. ""It is giving permission from the governing party to use disinformation in the election."" Mr Dutton did not respond to a request for comment. Independent MP Zali Stegall said the posts demonstrated the need for tougher laws that penalised misleading political messaging. ""I think it's very inconsistent for the government, who on one hand pledged to introduce truth in political advertising [laws] and are now essentially launching a Mediscare 2.0,"" she said. Ms Stegall is launching a voluntary ""ethical political advertising code"" for political parties and other groups that campaign during elections. ""Polling shows that 9 out of 10 Australians agree that we should have truth in political advertising laws … they don't like politicians lying to them.""

The mystery of MP's empty office that has allegedly 'broken the rules',Anne Webster under fire for using $24k office budget on election advertising,2025-02-13 10:50:59,"The federal member for Mallee has rejected claims a new empty office in her electorate could amount to a misuse of public funds. Nationals MP Anne Webster opened a third office in her electorate in December, utilising a $24,000 budgetary fund for satellite offices available to larger regions.   But this office, in the regional town of Horsham, is unlike her others.  Externally, it is covered from floor to ceiling with opaque promotional advertising. Inside, it is completely bare. Dr Webster has access to $24,000 each financial year to run a satellite office due to the size of her electorate. She told the ABC she was using that funding pool to run an empty shopfront as a billboard in the lead-up to the federal election.  But some political experts claim Dr Webster’s new office is ""deceptive"" and ""false"", and that she breached funding rules by using the office money for the sole purpose of advertising. Dr Webster has rejected these assertions. Nationals MP Anne Webster was first elected as the member for Mallee in 2019. (Supplied) Dr Webster was elected in 2019 and maintains a 19 per cent margin in the Mallee seat. She said she had used her allocated satellite office budget to lease an empty commercial space for six months on the main street of Horsham and install a 6x3 metre shopfront advertisement. The ABC understands the lease will cost Dr Webster $19,250. Dr Webster said while she ""could"" use the empty Horsham space as an office she had no plans to do so. She maintained the space was empty, not in use as an office, and was ""clearly a billboard"". The signage on Dr Webster's Horsham office in Janurary (left) and February (right). (ABC Wimmera: Julia Bergin) In January, the shopfront listed a bevy of services available, but little else. By mid-February, an addendum appeared to note that the ""office"" was unmanned. Dr Webster did not respond to questions about this change. Dr Andrew Hughes says use of an office budget for a non-functioning office is a breach. (Supplied: Andrew Hughes) Australian National University political marketing expert Andrew Hughes said the office was just a closed door and in his view amounted to a breach of the rules. ""Had she put a desk in there she'd pass the test, but if it's not being used it doesn't qualify as an office,"" he said. ""There's billboards from floor to ceiling. There's no items which you would associate with an office that is active — and it's not staffed either."" All MPs receive funding for up to three electorate offices, depending on the size of their patch.  Those representing areas greater than 3,500 square kilometres, such as Dr Webster, can also apply for separate funding for a smaller ""satellite"" office.  Unlike a standard office where politicians are handed the money, a satellite office is a private lease.  The politician pays the bill and is then reimbursed by the Commonwealth. These offices can host signage and advertising but, according to the Commonwealth's ruling, any money spent must be for the ""dominant"" purpose of conducting parliamentary business.  This includes anything an MP does in and out of parliament, including activities to ""support or serve"" constituents. Dr Anne Webster speaks to parents at a kindergarten in her electorate. (ABC Wimmera: Alexander Darling) Dr Webster's building-wide advert — which spans two windows and a double glass door — includes 18 things the Nationals MP ""can assist"" voters with, three policy priorities, photos of Dr Webster and her contact details. Dr Webster said the satellite office budget was not enough to do anything beyond ""put stuff on the windows"" of the vacant shop for six months. In a statement to the ABC, Dr Webster maintained that all costs were ""within the guidelines and entitlements for satellite budget funding"". The Department of Finance declined to comment on specific allegations. Toby Ralph says Ms Webster's shopfront window display looks like an office. (Supplied: Toby Ralph) Political strategist Toby Ralph said Dr Webster's shopfront advertising was ""mildly deceptive"".  ""To the casual punter it looks like an office, but it's just the windows, dressed to look like an office,"" Mr Ralph said. Centre for Public Integrity director Geoffrey Watson said Dr Webster's ""false"" Horsham office was ""yet another instance"" of Australia's political system playing favourites. Geoffrey Watson SC says Australia's political system favours incumbents. (Supplied: Geoffrey Watson) He said funding provided to sitting MPs gave incumbents a ""huge advantage"" going into an election. ""This particular MP is able, through government funding, to spread themselves around,"" Mr Watson said. ""If I'm going to run as independent, I'd be lucky to scrape together enough people for one office. ""It's deceptive and yet another instance of the incredible advantage that our system provides to incumbents."" Dr Anne Webster's electorate office in Mildura. (ABC Mildura: Timu King) Dr Webster's division of Mallee measures almost 82,000 square kilometres and has been a safe Country/National Party seat for nearly 70 years. Research from the Australia Institute found financial advantages afforded to incumbents to be more than $2.9 million in a three-year electoral cycle and greatest for politicians in large electorates. The report highlighted how satellite office entitlements — which applied to 44 of 151 federal electorates larger than 3,500 square kilometres — could double as campaign resources. ""These entitlements set incumbents up with fully operational offices that can be used as a foundation for a re-election campaign,"" the report read. In a statement, Dr Webster said the Horsham office was leased with the intention of providing constituents information and access to herself.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-12/anne-webster-satellite-office-budget-to-advertise-election/104845720
Doctors pitch plan to lift bulk-billing rate to 85 per cent,Doctors pitch plan to lift bulk-billing rate to 85 per cent,2025-02-11 04:52:37,"Australians under 35 would have greater access to free GP visits, bulk-billing rates would be lifted and out-of-pocket costs slashed under a bold plan championed by the nation's doctors, as the major parties finalise their election pitches before voters head to the polls. Ahead of a federal election campaign that will largely be fought on cost-of-living issues, the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) is calling on the major parties to commit to a wide-range of changes including training more doctors, cutting out-of-pocket costs for longer consults and expanding the eligibility of the so-called bulk-billing incentive. ""If our plan is implemented, it will immediately improve access to affordable GP care and ease cost-of-living pressures,"" RACGP president Michael Wright said. ""All Australians should have affordable access to a GP who knows them."" The bulk-billing incentive is an additional payment encouraging doctors to directly bill Medicare for a service, meaning the patient does not have any out-of-pocket costs. The incentive was tripled by Labor in 2023, but currently only applies to children under 16 and concession card holders. The RACGP wants that expanded to include everyone under 35, saying young Australians aged 25-34 are the most likely to delay care because of the cost. ""That's why we're asking for that bulk-billing incentive to be increased for this group, which we think will be a sustainable measure to improve their access so that people aren't putting off seeing their GP because they can't afford it,"" Dr Wright said. ""And no one should be having to make a choice between paying for their bills or paying for their GP appointment."" Sam Thomas was studying in Canberra until recently. (ABC News) That choice is something Sam Thomas knows all too well. Until recently the 23-year-old was studying in Canberra, struggling to live off the Youth Allowance payment. ""I would have to consider how badly I needed a GP, and most of the time, it was not badly enough,"" they said. When Sam did have to go to the GP, tough decisions had to be made. ""Visiting a GP cut at the margins so much that I would need to go without food. Sam Thomas has now moved back to where they grew up in the Blue Mountains, finding a doctor who bulk-bills. ""Having a proper universal health service in this country is essential to allow people to just function and survive and not get derailed by bad luck or other circumstances,"" they said. The ambitious RACGP plan sets out 19 initiatives, including calls for more federal funding to train 1,500 more GPs over the next five years and for a 25 per cent increase to Medicare rebates for GP mental health items. The college also wants out-of-pocket costs for GP consults longer than 20 minutes slashed from an average of $59 to $25, which it says would save Australians $268 million. The average out-of-pocket cost for a GP visit has risen by 4.1 per cent nationally over the past year, with patients in Tasmania, the ACT and NSW paying the most. The RACGP says its plan will deliver an extra 6.2 million bulk-billed GP appointments a year and bring the bulk-billing rate up to 85 per cent. Dr Wright said while its plan would require a significant federal investment initially, it would save money in the long run. ""I think Medicare has been significantly underfunded for more than a decade, so funding really needs to catch up so that we can deliver high quality care and so it's affordable for everyone,"" he said. ""We do know that there will be some additional upfront investment, but then widespread savings on the health system and it will also reduce costs for patients. ""So we're reducing the burden on patients, we're also saving the health system money by reducing the demands on emergency departments, on hospitals, and reducing the pressure that those parts of the health system are already facing."" Health Minister Mark Butler pointed to bulk-billing stats showing there had already been an additional 6 million bulk-billed GP visits between November 2023 and December 2024, on the back of its $3.5 billion move to triple the bulk-billing incentive. Federal Health Minister Mark Butler says more must be done to improve bulk-billing rates. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) Nationally, 77.5 per cent of all GP visits were bulk-billed in December 2024, an increase of 1.9 percentage points on October 2023. ""As a government, we urgently moved to protect bulk-billing for those who need to see their GP most often: pensioners, concession cardholders, and families with kids and young teenagers,"" Mr Butler said. ""Thanks to our efforts to strengthen Medicare, we've got more doctors, we've got more bulk-billing, and we've got Urgent Care Clinics that have already seen over a million Australians, all fully bulk-billed. Health will be a major focal point of this federal election, with Labor trying to highlight its focus on Medicare and seeking to contrast with the Coalition's record, noting Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was health minister when the then-Abbott government sought to introduce a highly controversial and politically costly mandatory fee for GP visits, a policy it later backed away from. Shadow Health Minister Anne Ruston said the Coalition had always increased funding for Medicare and would continue to do so if it won the federal election. ""It has never been harder or more expensive for Australians to see a GP than right now under Labor,"" she said. ""We are focused on ensuring all Australians have timely and affordable access to the healthcare they need, and we will announce our full suite of health policies in due course.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-11/doctors-pitch-plan-to-lift-bulk-billing-rate-to-85-per-cent/104920064
We're watching the demise of the two-party system in real time,"Two by-elections tell a bigger story about the wild, unpredictable federal election ahead",2025-02-10 04:30:16,"There's a saying often repeated in politics that voters always get it right. Victorian voters in the outer-western suburban state seat of Werribee have sent an unmissable message this weekend — they won't be taken for granted by Labor anymore. They have flexed their political muscle to say that they deserve the attention they feel voters in leafier, fancier suburbs receive. And they will make life very hard for politicians who they feel ignore them. Labor had held the state seat of Werribee since 1973, with outgoing MP and former treasurer Tim Pallas winning with a 10.9 per cent margin at the 2022 state election. While Labor is currently holding a very tight lead, the swing against the party was in the double digits. Both major parties received less than 30 per cent of the first-preference vote. But the result tells a much bigger political story. This weekend's by-election in Werribee also signalled something we know has been growing — the rejection of the two-party system. Victorian political reporter Richard Willingham analyses by-election results The weekend result can't be minimised and spun as just about state government issues. It is a devastating warning to the Labor brand that working-class voters in once-safe red seats cannot be relied upon to keep voting the same way. Labor heartland has now become volatile and that poses serious issues for Anthony Albanese as the federal election looms. Want to know what's really going on in Parliament House? Fran Kelly and Patricia Karvelas give you the political analysis that matters and explain what it means for you. But while Labor has suffered a monumental electoral backlash — even if they manage to hold on by their fingertips — the Liberals are hardly the beneficiaries of this discord. That raises serious questions for Peter Dutton's working-class voter strategy in outer suburbs. Beware of Liberals crowing too loudly about this result. They will talk big about the rejection of Labor but the real question for Liberals is why are they not getting the majority of the votes of the angry voters? Labor's primary vote in Werribee collapsed, but most of the lost Labor vote has gone to third parties and independent Paul Hopper. Voters are sending Labor a message, but they're not switching over to the Liberal Party as the alternative. That can mean only one thing — a federal election that will be a wild and unpredictable ride. It also means that Peter Dutton should be wary of believing that heartland Labor seats will look to him as their saviour. The political elite can often see voters in suburbs like this as low information or disengaged voters. The fact that so many parked their votes with third alternatives shows that they know exactly what they are doing, and they are moving beyond the political duopoly. There are some caveats to all this. What happened in Werribee has a lot to do with the parlous state of Victoria. This is a 10-year-old state government — and there's clearly a strong mood for change in Victoria. Time catches up with all governments. The cost of living in mortgage belt seats like Werribee is particularly acute and crime and law order is a huge issue in outer suburban seats. There are also the issues around state debt and spending — people basically think that Victoria is broke and they are annoyed about what that means for their standard of living. Local roads and infrastructure problems in the outer west are huge. People spend disproportionate time behind the wheels of their cars and that time is making them mad. This should, you would think, mean the other side of politics should be a more attractive option than they seem to be. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     That's not to say that the Liberals have nothing to be happy about. Their defeat of the Greens in the other by-election held in Prahran, in Melbourne's inner south — after former deputy Greens leader Sam Hibbins resigned after admitting he had a consensual relationship with a member of his staff — shows they are competitive again in the inner city. Labor declined to run a candidate in the seat, which was one of the few Greens vs Liberal contests in the state. A major swing against Labor in the Werribee by-election and a victory for the Liberal Party in Prahran may be a major warning for the Allan government. The unambiguous story here is genuine trouble for the Greens, who suffered in Brisbane at the recent state election, too. There are seats that will be competitive for the Liberal Party in the upcoming federal election, particularly in Brisbane. The trouble for the Greens brand is unmissable. They, too, will be a fascinating story at the upcoming federal election where some of their positions and strategies have ignited backlash from the community. With the federal election due within months, we are in genuine minority government territory. The major parties might not like that, but voters don't really care about their political comfort anymore and they are making that crystal clear.

"When the Greens and Barnaby Joyce agree, you know politics as we know it is in chaos",Donald Trump and Middle East chaos have up-ended Australia's politics in a way not seen 'since Vietnam war',2025-02-09 04:00:00,"Foreign events and global political trends from the war in Gaza to Donald Trump's hyper-kinetic return to office are shaking up the political status quo. And not always in the most obvious ways. ""Domestic and international politics are now completely integrated,"" says former home affairs department secretary and political observer Mike Pezzullo. ""Today we're talking about Gaza. Next week it could be something jaw-dropping about Ukraine, then perhaps a flare up between China and the US."" Each of these events — and the divided ways in which they are interpreted by voters through a fractured media — threatens to overshadow and distort politics in ways not seen ""since the Vietnam War"", he warns. As last week demonstrated, carefully calibrated campaign and media strategies are being derailed by events far away. Trump's Gaza-as-Riviera hallucination shows it can happen in an instant. For voters themselves, these developments are unfamiliar and ugly. They are testing and morphing definitions of the ""political middle ground"". One person's extremism is another's sensible centre. Tellingly, political strategists report community concern about ""social cohesion"" has spiked in recent weeks. Some voters appear to be wondering what has happened to their country, they say. How did the conflicts of others arrive on these shores? Is my local community still safe? And who is protecting us? Others suspect these worries are being amplified for cynical political purposes. Lack of social ""cohesion emerges as an issue when there's a risk of losing it"", says Pezzullo. What is not clear — based on conversations over recent days in Canberra with all sides of politics — is which party this maelstrom will hurt or serve the most. In political terms, it's very much a toss-up. This is a brief look beyond Israel's fortified border wall. For Anthony Albanese, arguments over the war against Hamas and destruction of Gaza have seen him condemned as weak and reactive. Labor has found itself squeezed between the outrage of pro-Palestinian Australians wanting stronger condemnations of Israel's government and local Jewish communities suffering antisemitism. That tension coalesced last week around criticism of the prime minister's response to Trump's Gaza's takeover suggestion. Albanese was chided by some for failing to slam the president's desire to take an ""ownership"" position in Gaza, which some likened to ethnic cleansing. Others saw Albanese's failure to acknowledge Trump for trying something different in a tired conflict, and a sign he has not accepted how fast Australia's closest ally is changing. How Albanese's handling of such vexed terrain plays out in seats across western Sydney and Melbourne, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, is very much front-of-mind for political strategists. Inner-city Teal or community independents are equally challenged, especially with MPs like Zoe Daniel, Monique Ryan in Melbourne and Allegra Spender in Sydney defending electorates with large Jewish populations. It's almost conventional wisdom among analysts that fears about antisemitism will send a wave of Teal voters back to the Liberal Party, even though Peter Dutton is more socially conservative than many voters in those seats. When it comes to Trump and foreign policy Australian politicians have learned not to jump at shadows too soon.  There are worries for Dutton's side as well, where an apprehension lingers that his staunch pro-Israel positioning undermines the Coalition's need to attract new groups of voters in lower-income battlegrounds. The last election was marked by drift among upper middle-class and professional voters away from the Coalition towards Labor and independents. This has left Dutton's re-election strategy hinged on capturing seats with large ethnic communities.  Many live under more economically challenged circumstances where cost-of-living pressures are most acute. In other words, ideal potential swing voters. ""This is where the Israel-Gaza thing doesn't really neatly line up as a plus for the Coalition because the electorate has changed dramatically,"" says John Kunkel, a senior economist at Sydney University's US Studies Centre and a former top advisor to Scott Morrison. ""It's a question of the size of the constituencies, in terms of sympathy for Israel versus sympathy for Palestinians. The maths of that aren't straightforward. ""For the Coalition you also need to think there would be a lot of Muslims who voted against same-sex marriage — so socially conservative — but won't vote for the Liberal Party because of Gaza."" The Greens are also rethinking their approach. Stung by setbacks in state and territory elections in the second half of last year, the party has toned down some of its more strident rhetoric, such as Adam Bandt's repeated accusations that Israel is committing ""genocide"". Such language gives Labor hope it can fend off the Greens in progressive seats like Macnamara, currently held by Josh Burns, a prominent Jewish MP. Albanese this week overturned long-standing Labor policy to pass mandatory sentencing laws for terror and hate crimes, not least to neutralise any charge from Dutton that the government is not taking antisemitism seriously enough. The Greens for their part backed the hate crimes legislation, but argued against the mandatory sentencing. Daniel and Ryan also voted against the mandatory minimum sentences. ""You cannot say you stand with the Jewish community if you vote against the real consequence that are necessary to deter this horrific conduct which we've seen in our country over the last 15 months,"" said shadow home affairs minister James Paterson. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Meanwhile, Dutton is balancing his own thin red line, between giving his base what they want — Trump-like certainty and culture-war take-downs — and appealing to the ""broad middle"" of the electorate that wants solutions to economic pain rather than political distractions. There was an intriguing display of these political sensitivities during a Sky TV segment early on Thursday morning, with a panel discussion between Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young and former Nationals deputy PM Barnaby Joyce. The opposition leader said Trump was a ""big thinker and a deal maker"" with a ""genuine desire to see peace and stability"". Asked to respond to Trump's latest edict — in this case a ban on transgender people competing in women's sport — Hanson-Young condemned it as a just another ""culture war"" deflection by a president avoiding hard solutions to the problems facing ""every day mums and dads… trying to put food on the table"". Joyce was then asked for his reaction, which long-term Barnaby-watchers would have assumed would trigger a full-throated condemnation of transgender people in women's sport. Instead, he sputtered. ""God, I hate to say this, but I kind of agree a little bit with Sarah on this one. We're focused on the cost of living … not the proclivities and issues of the United States on this issue."" Hours later, Dutton told Peta Credlin that he backed the US President's position. ""I think that's a perfectly reasonable position to hold,"" he said. A bemused Hanson-Young told this column that the exchange demonstrates how Dutton is at risk of ""getting sucked into Trump's extremist vortex"". Politically ""it's so cheap and easy, but it really distracts from talking about cost-of-living. I think that's his biggest risk. ""Cutting waste in ideological programs is not putting money in the pockets of mums and dads. Cutting welcome-to-country ceremonies doesn't make interest rates lower or make school fees cheaper,"" she said. Divisions, in other words, that derail social cohesion and leave voters bewildered, may yet backfire in an electorate seeking hard solutions.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-09/trump-gaza-foreign-issues-upend-politics-as-usual/104909980
"Albanese and Dutton promise big for the NT, with one major caveat",Big promises for the NT come with a big caveat in election season,2025-02-08 10:11:56,"Summer in the Northern Territory outback, when temperatures regularly soar above 40 degrees, isn't usually the traditional time for the nation's top politicians to visit. But with a federal election around the corner, the town of Alice Springs has welcomed Australia's prime minister and opposition leader on separate trips over the past two weeks. Both came armed with big promises and plans for change in the territory. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday announced $842.6 million to help support Aboriginal people living in remote communities in the NT through a series of targeted investments. Peter Dutton says a Coalition government would ""in principle"" support NT Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro's seven requests to address crime in Alice Springs. (ABC News: Xavier Martin) A week earlier, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton announced an elected Coalition government would work hand-in-glove with the NT government on its law-and-order issues. But with promises made so close to a federal election, both come with a major caveat — only one plan will be fully realised. Asked by a reporter what could stop cuts or delays to future funding, the prime minister put his pitch forward. ""Re-elect a Labor government,"" he said. ""Re-elect Marion Scrymgour as the Member for Lingiari, Luke Gosling as the Member for Solomon — that's how you stop the sort of cuts that we saw under the former government."" Anthony Albanese was in Alice Springs on Friday to announce a funding agreement that he said marked ""a great day for the territory"". (ABC News: Xavier Martin ) The NT only has two seats in the House of Representatives: Solomon and Lingiari. But both are hungrily sought after by the nation's political leaders, with Mr Dutton going as far as to suggest that the Coalition's path to victory in Canberra is reliant on winning the two. ""If we win Lingiari and we win Solomon I believe we can win at the next election,"" he said during a visit to Alice Springs last week. Lingiari is a vast seat comprising most of the NT, including its many remote Aboriginal communities and regional towns, which has been held by Labor for its entire 24-year existence. The kicker to that is, for most of that period it was held by one MP — Labor veterann Warren Snowdon, a stalwart from the Hawke government era who retired from politics in 2022. Marion Scrymgour holds the vast seat of Lingiari by a slim margin. (ABC Darwin: Peter Garnish) Last election, former NT deputy chief minister Marion Scrymgour held onto Lingiari for Labor, but only by a slim margin of 1.7 per cent. In the north, the electorate of Solomon comprises just Darwin along with parts of the nearby satellite city of Palmerston and the rural area. Traditionally a swing seat, Luke Gosling has now held it for a record three terms. So with a federal election expected to be held sometime before May the question may come down to whose messaging is best cutting through. Both parties have singled out Labor incumbent Luke Gosling's seat of Solomon as a key battleground in the upcoming election. Mr Dutton's rhetoric has leaned hard towards fixing the territory's protracted law-and-order issues — indeed, the party's candidates for both Solomon and Lingiari have backgrounds in the police. While Mr Albanese's announcement was aimed at showing voters across the region, particularly in the NT bush, that Labor is focused on fixing the root causes of disadvantage. Mr Albanese has also been clearer in showing that Labor's goal is to empower Aboriginal communities to forge their own change, through funding for remote groups and the like. Whichever way the pendulum swings on election day, the heightened focus on the NT by the nation's federal leaders has been welcomed by many, including the territory government. It's welcome proof that its challenging issues aren't just getting swept under Australia's rug.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-08/leaders-nt-focus-before-federal-election-spotlights-issues/104911610
Palmer locked in High Court battle to re-register United Australia Party,Clive Palmer takes fight to re-register United Australia Party before federal election to High Court,2025-02-07 15:26:39,"Clive Palmer will be in the High Court in Canberra today, as he fights to re-register his United Australia Party (UAP) ahead of the next federal election. The bid has some urgency, with predictions the next poll could be imminent. The High Court challenge is necessary because the UAP voluntarily gave up its registration after the 2022 election, citing ""administrative reasons"". But when the party went to register for the 2025 election, the application was rejected, because of a law that says a de-registered party cannot re-register at the next election, but must wait until the poll after that. The party's single senator, Ralph Babet, from Victoria, is leading the case in the High Court, backed up by Mr Palmer. They will tell the court the electoral law is invalid because it breaches the constitution, including impairing the implied right to freedom of political communication. Victorian United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet (right) was the only UAP candidate elected in 2022.  (AAP: James Ross) In a word — votes. Their lawyers' submissions to the High Court maintain that voting practices have changed, with fewer people using party ""how-to-vote"" cards. ""The vast majority of voters at federal elections give their first preference in the House of Representatives to a candidate who has a party affiliation on the ballot paper; and the vast majority of voters in the Senate elections cast their vote 'above the line',"" the submissions said. The submissions maintain that logos now printed on the ballot papers assist voters to recognise party affiliations. ""Those facts taken together, make it highly likely that at the forthcoming election a substantial proportion of voters will be looking to identify candidates of different parties on the ballot paper; and that registered parties will communicate their affiliation with endorsed candidates to voters by requesting the inclusion of the party name or abbreviation, and the party logo, on the ballot paper,"" they read. Without registration, the party said its candidates will be at a disadvantage. Mr Palmer will take his case to the High Court today. (ABC News: Gregory Nelson) Today, UAP lawyers will ask the High Court to rule on whether that constrains the ability of voters to make an informed choice, and whether it interferes with the constitutional right for senators and MPs to be directly chosen by the people. The High Court will also be told the ruling discriminates against candidates wanting to affiliate with UAP as a party. But the key issue raised in the case is whether the law burdens the ""implied right to freedom of political communication""'. The UAP maintains it does, and that burden is not legitimate or appropriate in the face of the constitution saying: ""…the inability of candidates endorsed by the UAP to identify themselves on the ballot paper as UAP candidates imposes a practical burden upon their ability to communicate their affiliation."" Lawyers for the Commonwealth say even if the law places a burden on the implied right to political communication, it is justified and appropriate. (ABC News) Not surprisingly, the Commowealth has taken aim at the UAP's claim, saying even if the law places a burden on the implied right to political communication, it is justified and appropriate. The Commonwealth says registration does carry the benefit of having a logo on a ballot paper, but it also carries obligations including disclosure of donations. ""In assessing whether (the provision) burdens political communication, the relevant counterfactual is not an unconditional right to receive the benefits of registration without the corresponding obligations"", the Commonwealth submissions said. Their submissions argued the UAP submissions offer no explanation for why a party might de-register only to seek re-registration within the same electoral cycle. ""Yet a possible explanation for a political party behaving in this way would be that it sought to obtain the benefits of registration (including the ballot paper benefits) whilst avoiding … the funding restrictions and transparency obligations that apply to registered political parties,"" the Commonwealth submissions said. The Commonwealth says there are other reasons for the provisions, including to prevent confusion for voters when there is de-registering and re-registering of parties with a similar name. Its submissions also say there is no burden on voters making an informed choice because it doesn't prevent a candidate running for the party or prevent the UAP and Senator Babet from using the party name in the parliamentary process and the ""broader political debate and campaigning"". ""If [the section] burdens political communication at all, that burden is slight."" The High Court will deliver its decision on whether the law is at odds with the constitution on Wednesday. Mr Palmer has had a long association with Australian politics. (ABC News: Christopher Gillette) Mr Palmer is no stranger to politics. In 2013, he was elected to represent the Queensland seat of Fairfax, under the Palmer United Party. He also had a third party, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party.  Mr Palmer resigned before the 2016 election. The United Australia Party was first registered in 2018 and ran in the 2019 election, spending tens of millions, but securing no seats. The campaign had targeted Labor, and later Mr Palmer suggested he could claim the credit for delivering government to Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The party has run candidates in all House of Representatives and Senate elections. But despite millions spent on campaigning, in 2022 the party delivered only one Senate seat, to Senator Babet in Victoria.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-07/high-court-united-australia-party-registration-election/104906678
It's a federal election year. So when will the election actually be held?,When will the next federal election be in Australia?,2025-02-07 14:07:23,"Canberra is once again abuzz with politicians and their cadres of staffers, with the first sitting fortnight of the new year well underway. But the fact that parliament is sitting at all in February has surprised some, after last year's speculation that there would be a federal election in March. Trying to guess election dates before the prime minister lets us in on his thinking is always a somewhat futile exercise, but that has never stopped feverish speculation throughout the press gallery and beyond. All we can say for certain until Anthony Albanese calls the election — a decision that is wholly his — is that we will go to the polls on a Saturday on or before May 17. But given the government is midway through a full sitting fortnight, and if we presume they won't cut parliament short, the number of possible election dates has fast dwindled. By our count, six dates could feasibly be the one, and conventional wisdom states that four of those are more likely: April 12 or the first three Saturdays of May. Between now and May 17, there are a few things on the calendar that complicate when the government can go to the polls. First of all, there's a much-anticipated interest rate announcement on February 18. It's considered unlikely the prime minister will call an election before then, lest he lose out on the good vibes that could come from a rate cut. If that were to eventuate — and it's an if— many believe it would prompt Mr Albanese to go sooner rather than later to capitalise on the relief felt by mortgage holders. Australians could head to the polls in a federal election within months. So when will it be and what are the key seats in the battle to lead the country? Then there's a West Australian election scheduled for March 8, and two campaigns running at the same time could get messy. But the government likes to keep us on our toes, and over the weekend there were suggestions that the election might in fact be called in the middle of the West Australian run-up, creating a dual-campaign Frankenstein. While that would be an unorthodox move, it's technically a possibility and could mean election day falls in late March. At this stage, the government is also scheduled to hand down a federal budget on March 25. An election held in May means they must go through with it for better or worse, while any earlier and the government can cross it out of its diary. So, keeping in mind those key dates, here's a month-by-month breakdown of what election days remain possible — and why some are more likely than others. (ABC News) There must be a minimum of 33 days between writs being issued by the governor-general, which dissolves parliament after the prime minister calls the election, and polling day. The maximum is 58 days, a horrifying proposition for nearly everyone involved, but thankfully Australian governments have typically favoured shorter campaigns. Therefore, if we assume the government will wait for the interest rate announcement before calling the election, the earliest it could be held is March 29. But this would mean starting the campaign in the last week of February, which would cross over with the West Australian state race. (ABC News) That brings us to April, a month chock-a-block with public holidays, making it hard to see many feasible options for a nationwide poll. Easter and Anzac Day take up the second half of the month, making that an unattractive option. An election in the first week, April 5, would also mean starting the campaign before the West Australian poll — making it, again, a bit messy. So, that leaves just April 12. This date has frequently been cited as the most likely eventuality as it avoids any overlap with the West Australian election and steers clear of the public holidays in the second half of the month. It also has the added bonus of allowing the government to skip the budget, if its forecasts for deficits now and into the future hold true. But Mr Albanese only has a slim window to make it happen. Let's assume he wants to give some space to the West Australian result before he calls the election. Writs would have to be issued no later than the following Monday — a public holiday in some states — to reach the minimum campaign length by April 12. (ABC News) If April 12 doesn't happen, May offers far more options for the government: May 3, May 10, and May 17 are all possibilities. But those dates also bring with them some baggage. For one, both Easter and Anzac Day would fall during the campaign period, which could slow down the race. While governments tend to try and avoid campaigns over the Easter break, they crossed over in both 2019 and 2022. Whether less time on the campaign trail is good or bad news for the prime minister depends on who you ask. (Remember his days in COVID isolation during the last election campaign?) Any of the May options would also require the government to hand down a federal budget. Again, whether that would help or hinder the government's chances is anyone's guess. But after the mid-year economic update in December revealed a gloomy economic outlook, avoiding a federal budget could be a nifty way for the government to avoid having to announce another troubling bottom line. The prime minister hasn't given us much to go off. ""We make decisions when we finalise them,"" he told The Conversation's Politics podcast over the weekend when asked if he had settled on a date. ""We certainly are working to hand down a budget in March."" We do know that Mr Albanese is a fan of longer terms because he often shares his belief that the current three-year terms are too short when asked when the election will be. But at this stage, with so few options left before the deadline, that doesn't really tell us much at all.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-07/when-will-the-australian-federal-election-be/104871714
Former Liberal MP who refused COVID vaccine to run as independent,Monash MP Russell Broadbent to contest 2025 federal election as independent,2025-02-06 08:29:09,"Federal Member for Monash Russell Broadbent says his opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines was ""absolutely"" behind the Liberal Party's decision to abandon him. The 74-year-old long-time parliamentarian quit the Liberal Party in November and moved to the crossbench, after losing preselection to Fujitsu government relations executive Mary Aldred. The seat of Monash lies east of Melbourne and runs from the Great Dividing Range to Bass Strait. Mary Aldred is the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Monash at this year's election. (ABC Gippsland: Millicent Spencer) ""Part of it was my stance on fair and reasonable taxes for middle Australia, part of it was my age,"" Mr Broadbent said. ""That's what [the Liberal Party] decided, that's their choice and so we get on with life."" Mr Broadbent refused the coronavirus vaccine and became an outspoken critic of mandatory vaccinations. On Monday he announced he would contest this year's federal election as an independent. He cited ""unprecedented"" and ""uncertain"" times as the key factors behind his decision, and insisted he still had the stamina to carry out his duties. ""I've never faced a political situation like we face now,"" he said. This will be Mr Broadbent's 14th federal election campaign, having lost in 1984 and 1987 before being elected in 1990. Despite his many years as a Liberal Party member, the veteran backbencher has never held a ministerial position. Mr Broadbent has long been an outspoken voice in the Coalition party room. (ABC News) He said it was ""very clear"" this was due to his willingness to stand up to prime ministers and go against party lines. ""You've only got to look at the record and read the things that I've stood up on,"" Mr Broadbent said. Australians could head to the polls in a federal election within months. So when will it be and what are the key seats in the battle to lead the country? ""They are matters of justice, they are matters of fairness, and they are matters of doing the right thing by the people of Australia."" In 2006, Mr Broadbent, along with fellow backbenchers Judi Moylan and Petro Georgiou, gained national prominence when he defied then-prime minister John Howard by opposing offshore processing of asylum seekers. He noted a career highlight was when he successfully advocated to the Morrison government about the plight of asylum seeker children. ""Getting children off Nauru would be the one thing that I'm very, very proud of,"" he said. Independents are well-placed to consolidate their position at the next election, according to Monash University political scientist Zareh Ghazarian. ""We saw in the 2022 election a real wake-up call for Australian politics,"" Dr Ghazarian said. Monash University lecturer Zareh Ghazarian expects the federal election to be tight. (Supplied) The Monash electorate recorded a swing against the two major parties in the last election, with independent Deb Leonard recording a 10.7 per cent swing in her favour. Mr Broadbent was ultimately victorious, receiving 52.9 per cent of the vote on a two-party-preferred basis. ""I would expect this contest to be very, very tight,"" Mr Ghazarian said. Mr Broadbent did not believe the Coalition would gain enough seats to form government in its own right. ""When you look at the seats they have to win and the seats they've lost over these last three election campaigns, which have been some of their best seats, it's very hard to put the numbers together to get 76 seats,"" he said. Mr Broadbent said it would be a tough campaign, but he had the backing of his community. ""I don't go in an election campaign with a view of losing, I expect to win,"" he said.

Conservative activist group exploit 'loophole' to target independent candidate,Advance targeting Wannon independent candidate Alex Dyson ahead of election being called to avoid breaking electoral laws,2025-02-05 05:53:24,"Conservative activist group Advance says it distributed flyers attacking an independent candidate before the start of this year's federal election campaign to avoid a ban on misleading campaign material once the poll has been called. The flyers feature a digitally altered image of Alex Dyson, a former Triple J presenter running as an independent in the Victorian seat of Wannon, ripping open his shirt to reveal a T-shirt featuring the official logo of The Greens. Mr Dyson is not a member of The Greens, and the party has not endorsed his campaign. The flyer mirrors posters and billboards Advance produced featuring independent ACT senator David Pocock and Teal MP Zali Steggall during the 2022 federal election, which the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) said at the time were in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC argued those campaigns breached section 329 of the act, which makes it an offence to publish material that is likely to ""mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote"". The commission stopped short of seeking an injunction in court because Advance agreed to stop displaying them shortly before election day in 2022. In 2022, the AEC said signs like these were misleading. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson, file photo) The AEC said it could not comment on the legality of the latest flyer featuring Mr Dyson because the section of the act only applies after an election has been called. The federal government is yet to set a date for this year's poll, which must be held before May 17. ""The AEC cannot say whether this specific material … would be a breach of the act if distributed at a different time — we don't comment on hypothetical scenarios,"" it said in a statement. When asked if it had intentionally distributed the flyers ahead of the official start of the election to avoid breaching the rules, Advance responded: ""Yes, this flyer was distributed to the entire electorate of Wannon before the issue of writs so there could be no question it is in conformity with the law."" In its statement, Advance said the flyer was designed to make a ""satirical point"". ""It is not misleading. Alex Dyson calls himself an independent, but his political beliefs align so perfectly with The Greens, he may as well be one,"" the statement said. Advance was launched in 2018 and describes itself as an ""independent movement that lives for mainstream Australia."" During the federal election, ABC NEWS will be shining a light on the hidden campaign, revealing how you're being targeted, why and by whom, and we need your help. Political donations data released on Monday revealed Advance received $500,000 from the Liberal Party-aligned Cormack Foundation in the 2023-24 financial year. The group did not directly respond to questions about whether the donation undermined its claim of independence. ""We don't comment on individual donors, but anyone contributing to ADVANCE does so because of their commitment to Australia's freedom, security and prosperity,"" it said in its statement. ""The 34,819 Australians who have contributed their own money to ADVANCE — whether it's $50 or $500,000 — do so because we campaign aggressively to defend and promote these fundamental Australian values."" Mr Dyson described the flyer as ""pretty grotty"". ""It's the kind of tactics that locals are really sick of,"" he said. Monash University electoral law expert Yee-Fui Ng said the 2022 case and the most recent flyer demonstrated a need for stronger misleading campaign laws that are enforced even outside of official election campaigns. ""This blatant getting around the rules through loopholes needs to be rectified because we are finding that organisations are exploiting whatever loopholes they can find,"" she said. ""Having political parties that tell the truth is quite fundamental to enhancing public trust in our systems and also enhancing our system of democracy."" Monash University's Yee-Fui Ng says organisations are taking advantage of weaknesses in electoral laws. (Supplied: Monash University) Wannon is held by senior Coalition frontbencher Dan Tehan, and the seat is expected to be one of the closest contests at this year's election. Mr Dyson has run as an independent twice before. In 2022 he achieved a swing of 9.6 per cent, helping cut the Liberal margin from 10.2 per cent to 3.8 per cent. He has the support of thhe Climate 200 fundraising group, which has contributed about $94,000 to his campaign.  The group, set up by businessman Simon Holmes a Court, is backing multiple progressive candidates around the country in this year's campaign. The Liberal Party has stepped up its campaign against Mr Dyson ahead of this year's poll and has also distributed its own flyer featuring an image of him ripping off his shirt to reveal a Greens T-shirt. The Liberal Party has produced its own flyer suggesting Alex Dyson is a Green or teal in disguise. (Supplied) In a statement, the Liberal Party rejected suggestions that its flyer was misleading. ""Facts are important, and Mr Dyson has shown he is not up to the job if he thinks that he shouldn't be held to account for his views, and those of his Teal colleagues,"" the party said. Unlike the Advance material, the Liberal Party flyer notes that the image has been digitally altered — something the AEC said in its statement could be a factor in people assessing the material. ""As always, we encourage voters to check the source of material when they're consuming election messages,"" the AEC said. The Liberal Party has also paid for several ads targeting Mr Dyson on Facebook and Instagram this year. One ad launched in January features a video from Country Liberal Party Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, in which she claims ""Alex Dyson is really a Green pretending to be an independent."" ""He wants to further increase your electricity bills by reintroducing a carbon tax,"" Senator Price says in the video.

Three-day childcare guarantee could pass parliament this fortnight,Three-day childcare guarantee could pass parliament this fortnight,2025-02-03 17:01:01,"Changes that would allow most parents to access three days of subsidised child care a week, regardless of whether they are working or not, could pass through federal parliament within weeks. The federal government flagged the changes late last year, with the expectation Labor would take them as a commitment to the next election. Instead it is moving to legislate the changes in what could be the final two sitting weeks before the election, in an effort to force the Coalition to show its hand on a likely election issue. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made an election pitch for a $1 billion fund to construct more childcare centres, including some co-located inside schools, and the end to the ""activity test"" that restricts child care subsidies. Labor has pitched the move to partially dump the controversial ""activity test"" as a step towards a universal childcare system. The activity test requires those receiving childcare subsidies to be working, actively looking for work or volunteering. A number of studies on child care, including a recent Productivity Commission report on the issue, have argued the activity test limits access to early learning for the children that would benefit most, while providing very little boost to workforce participation. Childcare subsidies are offered on a sliding scale of support to families earning up to $533,280 a year. While the Coalition is likely to oppose the bill, both the Greens and independent senator David Pocock have indicated they are open to supporting it through the parliament. That puts the government within reach of having the numbers to pass the legislation this fortnight, with support from a handful of other crossbench senators such as Lidia Thorpe, Fatima Payman, Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrell. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said she was optimistic the bill could move through within the fortnight. ""I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to [pass the bill],"" she said. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher says she is optimistic the bill can move through within the fortnight. (ABC News: Michael Barnett) ""And that says — and this is the PM's big push to universal child care — if you are a child under school age in Australia, you are entitled to subsidised care three days a week. ""That is a big change."" The Coalition was critical of the pitch when the prime minister first made it late last year, arguing the activity test was a critical element of the childcare system. Shadow Minister for Early Childhood Education, Angie Bell, told Sky News on Monday that while the Coalition would look through the detail, those concerns remained. ""Our position on the activity test is that it's a very important measure to make sure that $15 billion worth of taxpayer subsidy goes to those who are working, training or looking for work,"" she said. Shadow Minister for Early Childhood Education Angie Bell says concerns remain. (AAP: Mick Tsikas) But the Greens have indicated they are keen to see the bill pass the parliament, arguing the activity test should preferably be dumped altogether. Party leader Adam Bandt said the party was willing to work with the government if it wanted to pass the bill quickly. ""If the government wants to get legislation through this fortnight to go some way towards what the Greens have been calling for — and make child care and early childhood education accessible and affordable to everyone in this country — then we're prepared to work with them and make it happen,"" he said.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-03/childcare-guarantee-could-pass-parliament-this-fortnight/104891640

Why Dutton has changed his tune on China,"Peter Dutton walks more softly on China, with election in mind",2025-01-31 06:54:36,"When Peter Dutton was asked this week whether a Coalition government would continue to foster trade relations with China, he declared unequivocally that ""the relationship with China will be much stronger than it is under the Albanese government"". Two points stood out: Dutton's own positive rhetoric, and his apparent confidence about the future of Australia-China relations. It's not unusual for opposition leaders to undertake a makeover, to their person or policy, as an election approaches. Anthony Albanese lost weight and acquired new glasses. Earlier, he'd made Labor a small policy target. Dutton is simultaneously attempting a softening on some fronts — while retaining the ""hard man"" image on others. Mid-last year Dutton said: ""I'm pro-China and the relationship that we have with them. I want that trading relationship to increase … We need to make sure we strengthen the trading relationship because there are many businesses here who rely on it. But we have to be realistic about working to keep peace … we live in a very uncertain time. The prime minister also says that we live in the most precarious period since World War II, and he's right, and we need to work hard at peace as well."" Contrast Dutton as defence minister in 2021. ""Does the Chinese government wish to occupy other countries? Not in my judgement. But they do see us as tributary states. And that surrender of sovereignty and abandonment of any adherence to the international rule of law is what our country has fought against since Federation."" It's not that Dutton has changed his views on China. Rather, he's camouflaged them with a softer tone, and in what he chooses to emphasise. Of course circumstances have changed — Australia now has a much better relationship with China. But significantly, Dutton needs to appeal to the local Chinese-Australian voters. At the 2022 election, the Liberals took a big hit among voters of Chinese heritage. The party's review of its election performance, undertaken by former party director Brian Loughnane and frontbencher Jane Hume, said: ""In the top 15 seats by Chinese ancestry the swing against the Party (on a 2PP basis) was 6.6 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in other seats. There are more than 1.2 million people of Chinese heritage living in Australia today. Rebuilding the party's relationship with the Chinese community must be a priority during this term of Parliament."" Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Marginal Labor seats that are targets for the Liberals, where the Chinese vote is significant, include Reid and Bennelong in NSW and Chisholm and Aston in Victoria. Dutton (and the PM) will attend a Lunar New Year celebration in Box Hill in Melbourne this weekend. It's notable that David Coleman, named by Dutton last weekend as the opposition's new spokesman on foreign affairs, has worked extensively with the Chinese community. One of the contenders for the post was the high-performing James Paterson. There may have been stronger arguments for keeping Paterson in home affairs, but his very hawkish stand on China might have been in the mix. Talking up the positive side of the Coalition's record on China, Dutton harked back to the signing of the free trade agreement under the Abbott government, and said ""we want there to be mutual respect in the relationship"". Over its years in government the Coalition's relationship with China has varied between pragmatic friendship and suspicious negativity. After relatively smooth sailing in the Abbott period, things soured when the Turnbull government called China out over foreign interference, introducing legislation, and banned Huawei from the 5G network. Then relations plunged dramatically when the Morrison government demanded an inquiry into the origins and handling of the outbreak of COVID in Wuhan. US tech stocks plunge as Chinese-developed AI upends expectations (Rachel Clayton) Despite Dutton's confidence, it's more than possible that managing the China relationship after the election could be trickier than it has been during this one, no matter who is in power. The Albanese government can claim the greatly-improved bilateral relationship as one of its major foreign policy achievements. China has brought Australia out of the deep freeze, lifting the $20 billion worth of trade barriers it had imposed. Dialogue and ministerial exchanges have resumed. Anthony Albanese has been welcomed in China. But this week's speculation relating to the new Chinese artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek is just the latest reminder of perennial security suspicions about the penetration of Chinese technology.(Incidentally, Dutton has an account on the Chinese-owned TikTok — despite it being banned from official government devices — in part to engage with the local Chinese community, as well as with younger people generally.) Australia's minerals industry is potentially vulnerable to Chinese displeasure. The Senate in the next fortnight will consider the government's Future Made in Australia legislation, that provides a tax incentive for processing critical minerals. The Chinese have a global stranglehold on this processing — and have shown a willingness to weaponise it, for example against Japan. China's multi-billion dollar funding of nickel processing in Indonesia has had a dire impact on producers here in Australia. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     The change of government in Australia certainly facilitated the improvement in the bilateral relationship, but that improvement was also strongly driven by China's own interests. Similarly, the future of the relationship is more in China's hands than in Australia's. China expert Richard McGregor, from the Lowy Institute, says:"" Relations with China are inherently volatile. ""The day-by-day relationships have returned to a degree of normality. But all of the structural stresses which created antagonism are still there."" These include China's ""military assertiveness in the region, competition between the US and China, Australia's concern about foreign interference and hacking, China's efforts to build their power in the Pacific at the expense of Australia. None of that has gone away,"" McGregor says. The single biggest change of recent years ""is that ""China has become much more powerful and is far more willing to throw its weight around"". Separate to any hiccups in the bilateral relationship, Australia could find itself caught in the crossfire if there is a serious deterioration in the US-China relationship under Donald Trump — notably if his tariff policy leads to a trade war. Simon Jackman, from the University of Sydney, warns that if US policy hit the (already struggling) Chinese economy, that would affect Australian exporters. ""US tariffs or import bans that slowed China's economy would cause some short to medium headaches for Australian exporters,"" Jackman says. ""As in Trump Mark 1 and COVID, Australian export industries would find themselves looking for opportunities elsewhere, if global supply chains had to re-equilibrate in response to an upheaval in the US-China trade relationship."" Ironically, the earlier search for diversified markets when the Chinese imposed their restrictions on Australian producers would have helped prepare exporters for such a contingency.

Jacinta Nampijinpa Price plans to review Welcome to Country funding,Jacinta Nampijinpa Price plans to review Welcome to Country ceremony funding if elected,2025-01-31 10:21:53,"Coalition frontbencher Jacinta Nampijinpa Price says she'll review federal funding for Indigenous Welcome to Country ceremonies if her party wins government at this year's federal election. Earlier this week, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton handed the Northern Territory senator the shadow ministry for government efficiency in a cabinet reshuffle. Senator Price, who also continues in her position as shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, has now for the first time outlined her plans for the new role if the Coalition wins government. ""Going forward, what has come out of the result of the [Voice] referendum, is that Australians want to see taxpayer dollars work more effectively for them,"" she said. The opposition leader's refreshed line-up follows the prime minister announcing changes to his frontbench earlier this month ahead of an upcoming federal election.  ""Right across the board, [but] certainly for marginalised Indigenous Australians. Senator Price said she would ""look at an audit of the billions of dollars that are spent in the Indigenous space, so that we can understand where that can be better spent"", with a focus on the funding priorities of federal bodies such as the National Indigenous Australians Agency. She said she would also look to redirect funding currently used for Welcome to Country ceremonies. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price says the Coalition plans to redirect Welcome to Country funding if it wins government. (ABC News: Thomas Morgan) ""I don't believe that we should be spending $450,000 a [government] term on Welcome to Country, when that isn't actually improving the life of a marginalised Indigenous Australian,"" she said. ""That kind of funding could be redirected to actually improve the lives of marginalised Indigenous Australians, as opposed to being used for what is effectively a welcoming ceremony, many of which have now become quite politicised. Indigenous Australians Minister Malarndirri McCarthy told ABC Radio Darwin on Friday the Coalition was ""focused on culture wars"". ""We know that the Opposition Leader walked out on the Apology [to the Stolen Generations in 2008], he won't stand in front of the Indigenous flag, and now he doesn't want elders doing Welcome to Country,"" Senator McCarthy said. Malarndirri McCarthy claims Jacinta Nampijinpa Price will cut programs in the bush. (ABC News: Jayden O'Neill) ""I think we have to really ask the question, where is the Indigenous plan for the future with the Coalition and Senator Price?"" At a press conference in Melbourne, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was asked about Senator Price’s plans to review Welcome to Country funding. “I'm here talking about apprenticeships, talking about opportunities, talking about jobs, talking about support for cost of living,” he said. “What Australians are concerned about when I travel around the country isn't looking for culture wars and looking to divide.” Senator Price dismissed ""surprising"" comparisons of her new portfolio to Tesla owner Elon Musk's similarly-titled role in the new Trump administration in the United States. Mr Musk was named as the head of US President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, following his election in November. Mr Dutton's cabinet reshuffle came just weeks after the US announcement. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price says her new portfolio was not inspired by Elon Musk's role in the US. (AP: Susan Walsh) ""That was surprising that people were comparing me to Elon Musk, because certainly I don't have the same sort of bank account as Mr Musk has,"" Senator Price said. ""There was no sort of looking at what Trump was doing and going 'well, how can we do that over here?'  ""That certainly wasn't an inspiration for this particular role. ""I think it's come about because I've sought a more efficient way of spending dollars in the Indigenous portfolio, and I've said in the past that we should apply these sorts of measures across the board, to identify where waste exists in other portfolios."" Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has been in Alice Springs this week with Peter Dutton. (ABC News: Xavier Martin) The new Coalition portfolio has garnered scepticism from Senator McCarthy, who said she feared Senator Price would use the power to cut programs in the bush. On Thursday, Senator McCarthy told CAAMA radio that Senator Price was ""going to be responsible for cutting programs"". As the second year of the free summer youth program wraps up in Alice Springs, authorities say it has been a success. ""I'm worried. I think, is she going to cut … school holiday programs like the one at the pool, you know, the skate rink?"" Senator McCarthy said. ""These holiday programs are really important."" In response, Senator Price described the comments as a ""scare campaign"". ""We will expect a scare campaign from Labor, this is how they conduct themselves,"" she said. ""She's clutching at straws to suggest to Indigenous Australians that they're the sort of programs that are going to have their funding cut. ""An audit needs to determine what programs are being effective and supporting Indigenous Australians, and those sort of programs are … supporting vulnerable Indigenous Australians."" Senator Price has been in Alice Springs this week alongside Mr Dutton, where the pair on Wednesday announced that an elected Coalition government would offer its ""in-principle"" support to a series of measures aimed at halting crime levels in the Red Centre town.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-31/jacinta-price-government-efficiency-welcome-to-country-funding/104876630
Ball is in the RBA's court on rates — and the PM can't stop sweating yet,The ball is in the RBA's court on interest rates — and Anthony Albanese's waiting game goes on,2025-01-30 06:48:57,"It's the start of the election year Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers were banking on and the reason why talk of an early poll either late last year or at the very start of this year was always misguided. The prime minister and treasurer were both confident the rate of inflation would keep tracking down over summer, easing Labor's greatest political burden before heading to an election. So confident in fact, that Chalmers went out of his way over the past week to draw as much attention as possible to the quarterly inflation numbers due yesterday. He didn't want anyone to miss them. The treasurer was out every day building expectations of some better news in Wednesday's figures and pre-emptively claiming as much credit for the government as possible. The numbers needed to be good. And they were. Better, in fact, than the market expected, and the Reserve Bank itself had previously forecast. Underlying inflation fell to 3.2 per cent for the December quarter, the lowest it's been in 3 years and inching ever closer to the RBA's 2-3 per cent target zone. Economists quickly re-worked their forecasts, with growing anticipation now of an interest rate cut when the bank's board next meets on February 18. Economist says inflation result 'missing piece' in puzzle to cut interest rates The treasurer, who's copped plenty of blame for pushing up inflation with spending decisions in each of his budgets, is claiming vindication. The long-promised goal (of both the government and the RBA) to deliver a ""soft landing"" is now on track to be achieved. That means inflation coming down to more normal levels, without the pain and scarring consequences of high unemployment and recession experienced in other countries. The inflation figures give the Reserve Bank a green light to take its foot off the economic brakes. That gentle landing has, however, taken much longer to eventuate than even some within the government had expected, leaving a relatively tight window for any political benefits to flow before the election, which must be held on or before May 17. The government needs more than just an improved inflation number. Ideally it needs an interest rate cut, time for mortgage holders to see the benefit, and most importantly for angry voters to genuinely believe better times are ahead if they stick with Labor. The opposition argues it's taken far too long to reach this point, and the soft landing has been more like a slow burn. ""Inflation has remained too high for too long in Australia and because of that interest rates have stayed too high for too long,"" says shadow finance spokeswoman Jane Hume. The Coalition has adjusted its line of attack. It can no longer argue Australia has some of the highest inflation in the developed world. It's instead reminding voters of the pain they've experienced over the past three years. It's been ""the biggest collapse in standards of living in Australian history"", according to Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor. Inflation falls to 3.2 per cent, the 'best indicator' of a RBA rate cut Inflation may be easing, but the opposition needs households to hold onto the anger that swept incumbent governments from power last year. As the Financial Times has pointed out, ""the incumbent in every one of the 12 developed western countries that held national elections in 2024 lost vote share at the polls, the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of modern democracy."" Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Specifically, incumbents' vote share was calculated to have fallen by seven percentage points on average across the developed world. At the last election Labor recorded an historically low primary vote of 32.58 per cent. Newspoll this week suggested that vote had fallen to 31 per cent. A Freshwater poll last week put it at 32 per cent. Lower than at the last election, but nothing like the average 7-point drop seen elsewhere. Still, Labor's primary vote and the prime minister's approval ratings have been on a steady downward trajectory. Scoring a raft of legislative wins at the end of the year didn't turn the dial, nor did Albanese's series of road funding promises through January. At least not yet. The government hopes this inflation figure will finally shift momentum. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     When parliament resumes next week, the prime minister will hammer home his message about delivering ""low inflation, higher wages and higher employment"". He also wants to use parliament to put some heat on Peter Dutton. On the ABC's Afternoon Briefing yesterday, Albanese made clear he wants a vote on his planned tax credits for critical minerals and rare earths, opposed by the Coalition, but popular in Western Australia. He also wants to legislate fee-free TAFE in the coming fortnight and flagged fresh bills to come. The better news on inflation has given the prime minister confidence heading into a critical sitting fortnight and will help lift morale in his ranks. Bottom line, Albanese reckons he can use parliament to his advantage and is showing no signs of rushing to a March election. Allowing time for the Reserve Bank to potentially cut rates is even more important. Voters may have tuned out on the government, but are more likely to notice some mortgage relief.

The states that will decide the next federal election,The seats that will determine if Anthony Albanese or Peter Dutton is the next prime minister,2025-01-28 11:48:19,"Within months (if not weeks) Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will send voters to the polls for a federal election. Earlier in his first term, gaining a second seemed likely but the combination of soaring inflation, a failed referendum and a war in the Middle East has made it much more complicated.  Albanese heads to the polls facing a frontline bigger than his Liberal predecessor Scott Morrison, with Labor candidates across the country facing serious threats from Liberals, Greens and independents.  The ABC has talked with party insiders and analysed polling data to assess the seats that will likely shape the election outcome.  By-elections, defections and redistributions in three states have the parties notionally holding different seats from the last election. Using Antony Green's revised electoral pendulum, Labor enters the contest holding 78 seats, which includes the new WA seat of Bullwinkel and the currently Liberal-held Victorian seat of Menzies. The Coalition has 57 seats, which includes the currently Labor-held NSW seat of Bennelong and two formerly held Coalition seats prior to defections to the crossbench.  The Greens, minor parties and independents hold 15 seats.  Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington With 150 seats in the next parliament, 76 seats represents a majority, meaning Labor can only lose two seats to continue governing in its own right. For the Coalition to get to a majority, it needs to win 19 seats.  Former Victorian Liberal director turned pollster Tony Barry told the ABC he thinks the Coalition on ""a sunny day"" (ie best-case scenario) could win seven seats in Tasmania, Queensland, WA, SA and the NT. The Coalition would still needing another 12 seats to reach a majority, leaving Victoria and NSW as the states with the most at play this election.  Political observers estimate the opposition will need around half a dozen gains in Victoria if it wants to govern in majority. The state has become something of hostile territory to federal Liberals, with Labor reaching a high-water mark at the last election. Melbourne's outer eastern and northern suburbs might not be Labor's most marginal seats but they're among the most vulnerable, with living costs savaging household budgets.  Few on either side of politics expect Labor to hold Aston (3.6 per cent), which the party defied history and won at a by-election in 2023.  After losing neighbouring Chisholm (3.3 per cent) in 2022, the Liberals are optimistic of reclaiming it and will also target the coastal electorate of Dunkley (6.8 per cent) and the inland Holt (7.1 per cent) and Bruce (5.3 per cent), the latter two of which Labor has held for decades.  The Liberals have long hoped to win back McEwen, which stretches from Melbourne's outer north towards central Victoria. The seat is vulnerable for Labor incumbent Rob Mitchell thanks to dissatisfaction with the state Labor government and inflation. The Coalition too is eyeing neighbouring Hawke (7.6 per cent). If Labor loses a seat like Hawke, it will have much bigger problems on its hands. The Coalition is also talking up its chances of winning back Victoria's two teal seats Goldstein (3.3 per cent) and Kooyong (2.2 per cent). But Liberal frontbencher Dan Tehan could have a battle in his once safe regional seat of Wannon. He will again face independent, and former Triple J presenter, Alex Dyson, who has the backing of the Climate 200 fundraising organisation.  Labor too isn't without possible gains in Victoria. Having notionally been gifted Menzies (0.4 per cent) in a redistribution, its best chances of winning Liberal seats are in outer north-east Melbourne electorates of Deakin (0.02 per cent) and Casey (1.4 per cent).  Highlighting Labor's electoral woes in Victoria, the party will face serious threats from the Greens in the inner-north Melbourne electorate of Wills (4.6 per cent) and the inner south seat of Macnamara. The latter will again be a hotly contested three-corner contest where the flow of preferences will likely determine the outcome. Post-redistribution, Labor's margin against the Greens is just 0.4 per cent and 12.2 per cent against the Liberals.  Australia's most populated state presents a mixed bag of electoral fortunes, but like Victoria, offers few fortunes for Labor. Sydney's mortgage belt was once home to some of Labor's safest seats. Add in the Middle East conflict and Labor is facing a series of issues across the west and south-west.  Labor faces an inflation ring of pain that stretches from inner west Sydney in Reid (5.2 per cent), through Parramatta (3.7 per cent), to cabinet minister Michelle Rowland's western electorate of Greenway (7.9 per cent) and out to Macquarie (6.3 per cent), which takes in the Blue Mountains. Werriwa (5.3 per cent) and Macarthur (9.8 per cent) could also face threats.  The central coast seats of Robertson (2.2 per cent) and Dobell (6.6 per cent), and south coast seat Gilmore (0.2 per cent) are high on the Liberal hit list.  The NSW Hunter region too is presenting problems for Labor. Newcastle is Labor's safest seat in the country (17.9 per cent) yet the three Labor seats around it are anything but. The Coalition is optimistic of winning Paterson (2.6 per cent) and Hunter (4.8 per cent) and is eyeing nearby Shortland (6.0 per cent), which is home to cabinet minister Pat Controy. Further north and the Greens are talking up their chances of winning Richmond (8.2 per cent), which sits alongside the Queensland border.  Changing demographics in the coastal electorate, which is home to Byron Bay, have changed the electoral fortunes of a once conservative heartland seat. Labor's margin against the Greens in Richmond is now just 1.3 per cent. The Coalition is facing threats in at least three of its seats. Nat turned independent Andrew Gee will face his former party in Calare, having defected from the party due to its opposition to the Voice referendum.  The community independents who ran in 2022 in regional Cowper (2.4 per cent) and urban Bradfield (2.5 per cent) will again contest the seats. Teal Nicolette Boele's chances in Bradfield have likely benefited from Paul Fletcher's looming retirement.  Neighbouring Bennelong, once held by John Howard and now Labor's Jerome Laxale, became a notional Liberal seat (0.04 per cent) in a NSW redistribution. It was largely the Coalition that faced the community independent campaigns that delivered teals to the federal parliament in 2022. But this time, Labor too will face a similar movement, particularly in western Sydney, where dissatisfaction has festered following Labor's response to the war in Gaza.  Among the candidates is Dr Ziad Basyouny, who is running against Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke in Watson (15.2 per cent). Around one in three voters in Watson and Education Minister Jason Clare's neighbouring Blaxland (13 per cent) are Muslim.  Tasmania could be a surprise battleground this campaign. Independent Andrew Wilkie, sitting on one of the nation's safest margins in his Hobart electorate of Clarke (20.8 per cent), is likely the only seat without much of a challenge.  Both Labor and the Coalition see the potential for gains on the apple isle. Liberal Bridget Archer has repeatedly shown her ability to win on tight margins in Bass. She initially won the seat with a margin of just 0.4 per cent. At the last election, she did what many Liberals couldn't and grew her margin. Some of her biggest battles have come from within the party, where she's no stranger to speaking out and voting against Liberal positions. Having overcame an internal effort to oust her, she will need to defend her 1.4 per cent margin against Labor to stay in office. In neighbouring Braddon, incumbent Liberal Gavin Pearce will retire at the election. The opposition holds the seat with an 8 per cent margin but senator Anne Urquhart is giving up her seat in the Upper House to contest the seat for Labor.  She's not the only politician changing seats. Former state Labor leader Rebecca White is seeking to defend Lyons, where incumbent Brian Mitchell is retiring for her to contest his seat. The margin is 0.9 per cent  and is high on the Liberal's targets this election. Agriculture Minister Julie Collins is one of two Labor MPs currently being targeted by teal independents. She currently holds Franklin with a 13.7 per cent margin.  Anthony Albanese can thank WA for his majority. The teal victories in once safe Liberal seats knocked the Coalition from power. Winning a swag of seats in the west meant Albanese's Labor could govern in their own right. Labor unexpectedly benefited from an independent redistribution, which saw the creation of the new seat of Bullwinkel. Notionally a Labor seat, with a 3.3 per cent margin, the new outer eastern Perth electorate will host a high-profile three-cornered contest, including a former state opposition leader for the Nationals and a former Malcolm Turnbull spin doctor for the Liberals.  A senior Labor figure conceded the party couldn't believe its luck in the redistribution, arguing they would have been laughed out of town if they'd proposed the new maps (such was their favourability for the ALP).  Dolphin trainer turned first-term MP Sam Lim looks to have the biggest fight for Labor in his seat of Tagney, the party's most marginal seat in the west (2.8 per cent).  Teal MP Kate Chaney is facing the biggest threat on the crossbench as the Liberals seek to win back Julie Bishop's previously safe seat Curtin (1.3 per cent).  The Liberals too have woes in the west, having not re-endorsed long-term MP Ian Goodenough in Moore (0.9 per cent). The incumbent will contest the seat as an independent. Queensland's most senior federal figure, Treasurer Jim Chalmers, has long been vocal about his party's poor track record in the sunshine state. In the last decade, the party has been unable to replicate its state dominance into federal seats.  So much so that Labor has just five of Queensland's 26 seats.  With little to gain from Labor, the Coalition is eyeing off two Greens seats, having previously held both.  Former MP Trevor Evans will seek to win Brisbane back from Green Stephen Bates (3.7 per cent). The Liberals too hope to win back neighbouring Ryan from Green Elizabeth Watson-Brown (2.6 per cent). Labor too hopes it can win both seats in what will be three-cornered contests.  Labor insiders fear the retirement of Graham Perrett from neighbouring Moreton could make that seat the party's most vulnerable in Queensland. Those same insiders say Labor has for too many elections tried to spread resources across too many Queensland electorates, only to fall short in all of them.  They think the far north seat of Leichhardt (3.4 per cent) is among its best pick up chances, with high-profile Liberal Warren Entsch retiring.  The once safe-Liberal seat of Sturt looks set to attract the most attention at the election. Held by second-term Liberal James Stevens on a margin of 0.5 per cent, Sturt is among the most marginal opposition seats. Held for decades by Christopher Pyne, both Labor and the Greens are vying to snatch the seat from the Liberals but could be among the government's best chances to win a seat from the opposition.  After Labor prised Boothby from the Liberals in 2022, former MP Nicolle Flint (who didn't contest the seat last time) is seeking to win it back for the Liberals but will have to overcome Labor's Louise Miller-Frost's 3.3 per cent margin.  Labor currently holds all five lower house seats in the ACT and NT.  First-term MP Marion Scrymgour has the toughest battle ahead as she seeks to defend the geographically massive Lingiari, which takes in all of the NT except Darwin and surrounds. The margin is just 1.7 per cent. If the Country Liberals can turn territory election success into federal success, it would be the first time the party has held Lingiari.  In the ACT, the race for one of the territory's two Senate seats looks to be the main battle.  Independent David Pocock won his seat from Liberal frontbencher Zed Seselja. The Liberal campaign to win back the seat hit a snag, when it emerged its lead candidate faces disendorsement amid claims of branch stacking.  Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     It's a mug's game to claim to know when the election will be held, largely because picking the date is one of a prime minister's few unilateral powers.  Not that it stops us from guessing.  The one thing we know for sure is it will be a Saturday and no later than May 17.  We also know the minimum number of days for a campaign is 33 days and the maximum is 58 days (and good luck finding someone who thinks a two month official campaign is a good idea).  Between now and then are a couple of complexities, namely the Western Australia state election (March 8), Easter (April 18 to 21) and Anzac Day (April 25). Conventional wisdom suggests the PM is likely to call an election after WA's state poll. Calling it weeks after that would mean the government would hand down the early budget it has slated for March 25 but there are differing opinions on the political value of a pre-election budget.  Assuming there's no early budget, it leaves one date, something of a goldilocks period, that squeezes in between WA and the April public holidays and is considered most likely among politicians and political observers —Saturday, April 12.  Assuming the PM gives the victor of the WA election one day to celebrate, it would mean he'd set off to visit Governor-General Sam Mostyn on Monday, March 10 (awkwardly a public holiday in four jurisdictions) seeking an election, with the writs issued that very day. If the PM presses on with a budget, he's left with just three options all of which would be interrupted by Easter and Anzac Day — May 3, May 10 and May 17.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-28/federal-election-when-called-and-where-will-it-be-fought/104825066
Dutton is unlikely to read from Trump's playbook as the election nears,Dutton is unlikely to read from Trump's playbook as the election nears,2025-01-30 06:30:59,"The cameo role US President Donald Trump may play in our imminent election campaign, both rhetorically and practically, is the election wildcard that no-one can predict — and it is making political hardheads increasingly nervous.  First there's the unpredictability of Trump himself — will he insert himself into our election campaign and freestyle about ""radical left"" governments after being, potentially, drawn in by leading and loaded questions framed by somebody like, say, Nigel Farage? It's not hard to see it happening. While Albanese government ministers have been impressively disciplined in their language about the new Trump regime — avoiding any baiting to criticise — any expectation that this protocol will be reciprocated is naive. Just as Donald Trump is galvanising the world with all his wildness, Anthony Albanese has clearly decided that stability and calm is the best persona he can offer voters as our own election approaches. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said last week that there was ""no doubt"" in his mind that he would have a better relationship with the new US president than the current Labor government. Dutton said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had ""obvious"" philosophical differences with Trump that put him at odds of having an effective and productive relationship. Dutton is clearly and undeniably more profoundly aligned with Trump, from his anti-woke rhetoric to his harder line on immigration levels, there are philosophical synergies that he can no doubt amplify. But it is fanciful to believe that Australian voters, who have consistently in surveys expressed concerns about the rise of Donald Trump and Trumpism, will be motivated to vote for Dutton on the basis that he might — on partisan lines and philosophy — get along with Trump better than our current PM. Dutton may want to use some of Trump's populist strategies, but any suggestion he will cut and paste the entire Trump playbook here is wrong. That became even clearer over the past week. That's not to say that the Coalition isn't emboldened by what is a rolled gold backlash to progressive language and causes — but there is selective picking and choosing going on to create a distinctly Australian flavour that meets the expectations of our electorate where compulsory voting still plays a moderating role on what people are inclined to care about. There are two key moments that demonstrate that difference.  Peter Dutton shut down his Nationals counterpart's suggestion that Australia should ""lean into"" the gender debate, after Trump's executive order rejecting recognition of transgender people in the United States. David Littleproud, leader of the Nationals, said Australia must also consider the issue of gender in light of Trump's move, declaring there were only two recognised genders under the ""biological reality of sex"". ""We just need to take a deep breath on this, it doesn't need to get emotional. We just need to understand it also comes back to respect, it comes back to respecting that biological basis that we can't get away from when we're born,"" Littleproud said.   ""I think we can do that in a sensible way without vitriol, without upsetting anyone, but just respecting there are some changes I think in our society that we need to lean into."" But Dutton had something very different to offer: ""Australia is a sovereign nation, and as prime minister I'll act in our country's best interests, and I'll make decisions that I think are in the best interests of all Australians,"" he said.  ""We don't have any plans to change our position in relation to that issue."" Dutton also signalled a Coalition government would not follow Trump in withdrawing Australia from the Paris Climate Accords, despite yet again, internal pressure to do so. Dutton has argued Australia would be damaged economically, including through the imposition of tariffs by the Europeans and other nations by withdrawing from the Paris accord. Dutton's path to victory is complicated without winning back at least some of the seats his party lost under former prime minister Scott Morrison to what have now become Independent teal MPs. For some time there has been a view that perhaps teal MPs will have a harder path to re-election without the visceral electoral backlash to Scott Morrison.  There was a specific loathing of Morrison in the leafy parts of Australia that was central to the campaign strategy in those seats. Expect to see the fear of Trump and the idea that Dutton will be Trump-lite being used to activate voters. Peter Dutton is well known for his ""tough guy"" persona,. But with teal seats in the coalition's sights, the approach could spell trouble for the opposition leader Already Climate 200, which provides funds to Teal MPs to run their campaigns, has been using Trump's brand to fundraise. Calling for donations on their website they promise to use the money to ""Trump Proof"" Australian politics.   ""Dutton may have the support of fossil fuel billionaire Gina Rinehart, who partied election night away with Trump at Mar-a-lago, but independents have you"" they say. ""Every pro-climate community independent who sits on the crossbench is a crucial line of defence against Dutton's Trump-inspired agenda"".  Not so subtle, but will it work? The teals will zero in on fear of Trump — of which there is plenty in parts of Australia that are motivated by issues like climate change — but Labor is in a bind here.  How can they warn of Dutton's ""Trumpism"" and at the same time ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration?  Trumpism is no longer to be used as a derogatory term by the government like it has been by some in the past — those days are over — Trump's ascendancy has rewritten the politics. And there are parts of Trump's America First rhetoric that, despite Australians' overall distaste for Trump himself, do and will resonate here. Director of Redbridge Group Kos Samaras told this column that the same culture wars don't translate in Australia, and Dutton has been selective about what he will lean into. ""Australia is a much less religious country than the US. A lot of what is common public political discourse in that country on gender and fertility are seen by the majority of Australians as deeply private matters"". Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     Dutton is so far more strategic in when and how he uses issues that fit in the culture war space — but there was some evidence last week that the issues he does favour talking about — including the debate around the date of Australia Day — are being deftly avoided by the Labor Party.  There is no doubt that Australia Day — the date and flag — have become polarising issues in Australia and the defeat of the Voice and backlash against issues pertaining to the Indigenous rights agenda have swung in favour of the arguments Dutton has long been making. But Albanese can see a booby trap a mile off and believes that debates around the date of Australia Day suck oxygen out of a government that wants to exclusively be talking about cost of living and getting Australians ahead. Albanese poked fun at Dutton for having a fight with an imaginary friend when it comes to the annual Australia Day debate. Responding to a question about polling from the Nine papers that showed the majority of Australians do not support changing the date of Australia Day, Albanese said he was focused on the fullness and richness of the country's history. Asked if he supported Dutton's call to boycott pubs that refuse to celebrate Australia Day, the prime minister used the strategy if poking fun at the opposition leader. ""I sometimes think that Peter Dutton every year has a fight with an imaginary friend over something that most Australians are just getting on with, Australia Day,"" he said. ""And one of the things that Australia Day celebrates is the fact that we're not a Soviet-style command system. You know, like, just chill out! Get on with life."" A senior Labor powerbroker told me he believed Dutton would try to goad Labor into talking about issues outside of cost of living, which Australians clearly care most about and then accuse Labor of being obsessed with those other issues.  They say they are on high alert and will vigorously avoid being tricked into anything out of step with the main game — people's economic interests.  Dutton on the other hand knows that Australia isn't interested in being a mini-America and you will hear the word ""sovereignty"" from him to send the signal that he is not interested in replicating a carbon copy of the Trump agenda in Australia. That's not to say that he won't try to exploit a broader political vibe that is favouring politicians on the right — but just how and when he does is worth careful observation.  Over the weekend Dutton announced his new frontbench. The reshuffle included a new ""government efficiency"" portfolio to crack down on ""wasteful spending"" including the ""divisive Voice referendum"". The current shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, will be its spokesperson in a move which has eerie similarities to the new US Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Elon Musk.  Is this a new-found obsession for the Coalition? Not really, when former prime minister Tony Abbott was first elected there was also a focus on government efficiencies  But what matters now is timing. Dutton has made the calculation that a frustration with ""Canberra"" and waste is good politics. It could be — but it also risks the mother of all scare campaigns from Labor that it's a plan for slashing and burning.

Australia's election will ride the shock waves of Trump 2.0,"As Trump embarks on a disruptive new agenda, Albanese leans in to stability and calm",2025-01-25 11:43:37,"When Donald Trump left the White House after the 2020 election, what had become a daily habit for millions around the world upon waking — checking Twitter with dread to see what wild new idea was floating forth — gratefully came to an end. With his return this week, there's a 2025 version of the same phenomenon, though one that is also significantly different. The similarity in the disruption factor of Trump 2.0 is in the relentlessness, to date, of a blitz of new pieces of information to try to absorb every 24 hours. The difference is in the much more detailed and deliberate agenda he is setting out, no matter how disruptive it might be, compared to that of a man — and team — who had never expected to win in 2016. Donald Trump signs the first lot of executive orders, including moves to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and pardoning January 6 rioters. Here's what we know so far.   Amid the uncertainty, the focus in Australia has tended to be on potential first round effects: the prospect of tariffs on Australian goods, or in our defence relationship. But much more ominous is the cacophony of decisions and pronouncements that the 47th president has unleashed this week on everything from tax to investments in technology, from climate policy to taking off all the limitations on oil and gas exploration, from walking away from all sorts of forms of global cooperation like the World Health Organisation, to an assault on any kind of issue regarded as ""woke"". The impact of any one of these big announcements that Trump has made, if implemented, is almost impossible to say, let alone all of them at once. A massive increase in oil and gas production — just in economic terms — could, as he says, help drive global inflation downwards. But it would also obviously disrupt one of our largest export markets. This week Santos shelved the $3 billion Dorado oil and gas project off Western Australia. While there have been questions about the project for some time, the prospect of a plunge in prices on the back of a huge increase in US supply hardly helped. On climate, as former Australian Ambassador to the United States Arthur Sinodinos told 7.30 this week, in addition to changes in energy prices, the second element in terms of the broader climate debate is that China will see this as an opportunity. So, the danger here is that in areas where America vacates, there may be a temptation for China to play a bigger and more influential role. A lack of understanding of how trade tariffs work could come back to haunt Donald Trump but Australia's ambassadors who served during his first term warn that may not matter as he looks set to wield tremendous power. But Sinodinos's assessment was that ""on green energy generally"", the wall of money that is going into green energy across the world, the way in which the prices of renewables and other energy alternatives are coming down, means that it is not a lay down misère that the energy transition is halted in its track. There is so much momentum in that transition. Trump's pledge that the US will walk away from the so-called Basel III rules — post GFC reforms designed to ensure banks have enough capital to absorb losses — don't just worry bankers here but raise competitive questions for them, and regulatory questions for central banks. For Australian politics, his pledge to produce ""the largest tax cut in American history"", and to walk away from an OECD global tax deal which commits countries to a minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent and the taxation of digital companies without a physical presence, puts tax competitiveness, and therefore tax reform, squarely back on the agenda in the next four years. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not going there when asked about this at the National Press Club on Friday in his first major address of this election year. But be assured the pressures Trump is unleashing will make the need to change inevitable. Of course, we don't really have tax policy discussions in Australia anymore, even though so many of the tax bases we rely on to fund government services are degraded. We get tinkering around the edges, or uncosted bits of political flummery like the Coalition's announcement in the past week about making business lunches free. Being brave on good policy is not a great recipe for political success these days, particularly when the balance of power is so evenly balanced between the major parties. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese addressing the National Press Club on Friday. (ABC News: David Sciasci) The definition of political bravery on tax these days was highlighted by the prime minister wanting to remind people that the government had been brave last year in breaking a promise and redesigning the stage 3 tax cuts of the Morrison era to assist lower-income earners deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Just as Donald Trump is galvanising the world with all his wildness, the PM has clearly decided that stability and calm is the best, and most natural, persona that he can offer voters as our own election approaches. It feels like he's been doing a lot of work over the summer on his presentation. There's more clarity around the messages so that instead of just mechanically rattling off a list of achievements that make your eyes glaze, he tries to give them some context and the spectre of being part of a bigger plan Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     At the centre of his message is reminding people that, no matter how tough they are doing it, inflation is coming down, wages are going up, lots of jobs have been created and Australia has avoided a recession. Asked on Friday what the headline achievement has been for his government, he did have a list. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington ""Keeping us out of recession. 1.1 million jobs. Getting inflation from a six to a two. Making sure that people's living standards are looked after — from a six to a two. Completing the NBN. Finishing Gonski … Turning the decline in Medicare around and, importantly, moving towards — just as Labor governments have created Medicare, [and] universal provision of superannuation — we're taking the steps, and I announced in December, for universal provision of childcare. ""This will transform the way that Australia functions, will transform opportunity and will make sure that every young Australian gets the best start in life."" There's plenty that he can rightly point to having been achieved amid the chaos of global inflation and uncertain Senate numbers. Whether people are listening, or grateful, remains uncertain. And whether he can re-engage them in a global political landscape of shock and awe is even less certain.

'Nationals aren't the party they once were': Campaign to flip safe seats,Inside the community independents movement targeting key marginal seats at the next federal election,2025-01-23 15:46:05,"Last time around, she nearly flipped a safe Nationals seat that had been in the party's hands for half a century. But still it took a ""rigorous consultation process"" involving dozens of kitchen table conversations, detailed reports and an audition of sorts for the residents of Cowper to select Caz Heise as their candidate at the coming federal election. In truth, Heise hasn't stopped campaigning in Cowper, an electorate bookmarked by Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast, since she was narrowly defeated in 2022 by incumbent Pat Conaghan, a former police detective. But such is the grassroots nature of the Voices movement, that her candidacy for the 2025 rematch ""wasn't a foregone conclusion"", according to Phil von Shoenberg from the Voices4Cowper campaign. Shoenberg, a retired school teacher, joined the campaign because he liked the democratic, hyper local nature of it, and felt Cowper had been taken for granted by the Nationals for too long. ""We believe that Caz can make history this time, and that we'll have another community independent in parliament, a regional community independent,"" he told the ABC. Cowper — held by the Nationals and its predecessor, the Country Party, since 1972 — became the party's most marginal seat at the last election, now held by just 2.4 per cent. With predictions of a hung parliament, the stakes are even higher this time around. And regional seats could be the ones to fall. Heise is being backed by a new fundraising vehicle called the Regional Voices Fund, which is aiming to raise $2 million for rural and regional candidates who are climate-focused but ultimately there ""to represent the community, not to represent the interests of a party"".  Almost all of the candidates receiving support so far are women, and so are its founders. Led by lawyer Helen McGowan (sister of former Indi MP Cathy McGowan) and former NSW Rural Woman of the Year Lorraine Gordon, the organisers hope to build on the success of Simon Holmes à Court's Climate 200, which helped propel a raft of city-based community independents (nicknamed ""teals"") to federal parliament in 2022. The so-called teal MPs, from left to right: Allegra Spender, Monique Ryan, Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Zali Steggall. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) That election demonstrated the lag effect of opinion polling, and commentators believe the political threat posed by the teals was widely underestimated during the campaign.  There are, once again, differing opinions about the likelihood of a second surge of independents at this election, which will be defined by cost of living. Of the 21 candidates running under the broad community independents banner, published polling suggests the regional seats of Cowper, Wannon, in south-western Victoria, and Bradfield, on Sydney's north shore, are the most vulnerable. Community independent candidate Alex Dyson is contesting the Victorian seat of Wannon for a third election in a row.  (Instagram: Alex Dyson) In each case, it's a 2022 re-run: the independents who contested the three seats three years ago — and came close to flipping them — will be going up against the same Liberal and National incumbents this year. Wannon, held by Liberal frontbencher Dan Tehan, has also turned marginal because of independent Alex Dyson, who has spent the past two elections chipping away at what was once a traditional, blue-ribbon Liberal seat. Tehan's colleagues have noted the former trade minister has been spending a lot more time on the ground in his electorate, which stretches across 34,000 square kilometres of western Victoria, taking in Warrnambool, Hamilton and Colac. Dyson and Heise have both received funding from the Regional Voices Fund, which is also supporting the campaigns of incumbent Helen Haines in Indi and independent candidates contesting Farrer (held by deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley) and Calare in NSW, Casey and Monash in Victoria, Groom in Queensland and Forrest in Western Australia. ""Climate 200 has a focus on the city seats. What we're doing is similar, but our focus is rural, remote and regional candidates,"" Regional Voices Fund chair Lorraine Gordon says. Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate policies and promising a new era of fossil-fuel dominance, withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on his first day back in office. There is a crossover with Climate 200, which recently provided $50,000 in ""accelerator funding"" to four of the campaigns being backed by the Regional Voices Fund — Cowper, Wannon, Casey and Monash — as well as to independents running in McPherson, Moncrieff, Fisher and Fairfax in Queensland, and Bradfield. Again, the majority of candidates are female.  On its website, Climate 200 urges supporters to ""help them find the next David Pocock or Dr Monique Ryan"" and prompts for donations with a message to ""stop Trump-style politics in Australia"", depicting Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and the US president side by side. While Climate 200 and the Regional Voices Fund are topping up local fundraising efforts, it takes more than just money to successfully run for parliament.  There's a sophisticated ecosystem operating behind the scenes, involving coordination between groups focused on training, networking, strategy and branding, legal and financial support. Cathy McGowan launched the Community Independents Project when she turfed Liberal Sophie Mirabella from Indi in 2013. Three elections later, Indi remains an independent seat and McGowan's successor, Helen Haines, now sits on the largest-ever crossbench in federal parliament, alongside other community independents Zali Steggall, Allegra Spender, Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Monique Ryan, Zoe Daniel and Kate Chaney. Independent MPs Zali Steggall, Kate Chaney, Kylea Tink, Allegra Spender and Zoe Daniel help make up a large crossbench in the House of Representatives. (ABC News: Mark Moore) These professional women helped sweep the Morrison government from power in 2022, taking a swathe of Liberal-held, inner-city seats, and together, they are considered a bulwark against a Coalition win. Another organisation called Huddle — led by Ann Capling and Cam Klose, who worked on Monique Ryan and Cathy McGowan's campaigns — helps out in the very early stages of these campaigns. It works closely with communities interested in joining the grassroots movement, equipping them with ""the tools, strategies, and resources needed to launch compelling campaigns"". We live in an age that favours disruptors. In politics, in business, in media, in art and even sport. And there's precious little evidence to suggest that we're finished with them yet. From there, a Voices group is established under the Community Independents Project banner to select a candidate who then receives mentoring and coaching.  A formal campaign team follows, with financing from vehicles including the Regional Voices Fund and Climate 200, while political consultancy firms Populares and Watershed are on hand for advice on polling and communications. This ""ecosystem"" largely mirrors the campaign infrastructure of the major parties — right down to the number of people involved in preselections. Kos Samaras from RedBridge Group Australia says these community independents are undoubtedly the ""new wave"" in politics. He says there's a fairly simple formula for these campaigns to succeed: ""significant levels of disquiet"" towards the major party incumbent, and a candidate who voters see as a serious contender capable of actually winning. Kos Samaras, political analyst for the Red Bridge Group, says community independents are the ""new wave"" in federal politics. (Supplied: Peter Healy) Then you need a volunteer base capable of executing a campaign — this is where Samaras says community candidates can have the edge. ""Human capital matters more than money. If the right circumstances prevail, and you've got the right candidate, executed properly, it's not hard to dislodge [the] major party candidate,"" he says. Samaras believes Cowper will prove more difficult, because the Nationals have a ""strong brand"" as the only party of the country, and their candidates run very local campaigns.  Analyst Kos Samaras says the Nationals have a ""strong brand"" in Cowper, where Conaghan narrowly defeated his independent challenger in 2022. (ABC News: Sarah Maunder) The Labor and Liberal parties, conversely, are increasingly seen as ""distant"" to the grassroots. But Gordon, a former Nationals member, challenges that assertion, saying the Nationals are not the party they once were and ""nor do they hold the values the once did"". ""I think they're no longer the party of food and fibre, they're more the party of coal and gas,"" she says. ""The surge of independents will continue; the wheel will get squeakier and squeakier."" Lorraine Gordon, chair of the Regional Voices Fund, is backing climate-focused community independents at the 2025 election. (Supplied: Lorraine Gordon) She points to movements like Farmers for Climate Action — which has grown in membership from just 30 in 2015 to over 8,500 today — to demonstrate the level of support for climate action in the bush. A record one-in-three voters turned to independents, Greens or minor party candidates at the last election, in what was seen as a repudiation of Scott Morrison and his government's handling of issues broadly related to climate, integrity and women. As a result, a record 27 seats did not finish as contests between Labor and Coalition candidates, according to ABC election analyst Anthony Green. Some political strategists, and even a former prime minister, question whether the independents movement has peaked, given the circumstances that got them into parliament in 2022 have vastly changed in 2025.  This election is expected to be almost solely focused on the cost of living. On Monday night at the Sydney Institute, Paul Fletcher ripped off a fiery denunciation of the ""teals"" — the independent candidates who two and a half years ago tore a significant hole in the ranks of the parliamentary Liberal Party. Newspoll suggests the Coalition's primary vote has also recovered somewhat since the last poll, to around 39 per cent, while Labor's is hovering around 33 per cent, according to published polling.  Support for the Greens also appears to be on the decline, as demonstrated by the party's poor performance in last year's Queensland state election and a series of local government elections.   In Cowper — now considered a key seat — Heise has amassed an army of 3,000 volunteers and has so far received donations from 148 individuals. Momentum, she believes, is on her side. ""I think we are building something really special here in Cowper — the culture and level of engagement is beyond what I could have imagined,"" she told the ABC. ""Breaking the longstanding hold of the National Party requires a genuine connection with the community and trust in independent representation."" Her rival, Conaghan, did not respond to the ABC's request for comment. But within a few short months, voters will judge whether Heise has achieved her goal.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-23/climate-independents-fund-federal-election-campaign-teal-success/104837648
Australian culture is 'at a crossroads'. These artists want it on the agenda,"Christos Tsiolkas, Tim Winton and Charlotte Wood advocate to Save Our Arts ahead of federal election",2025-01-20 13:14:32,"When Christos Tsiolkas was writing The Slap, he was working as a veterinary nurse. ""I was in between jobs and my friend, who's a veterinarian, suggested I work for him for a few months until I got back on my feet,"" he says. ""It gave me the space to write."" Before he became a veterinary nurse, he worked as a film archivist, removalist, administrator and cleaner, all while writing on the side. He released three novels between 1995 and 2008's The Slap. That book — about a group of people at a barbecue whose lives are changed by the slap of the title — won a slew of awards, became an international bestseller, and was adapted into an Australian TV series in 2011 and an American one in 2015. It was only after that book's success that Tsiolkas — in his late 40s and 20-odd years into his writing career — could make a living out of writing. The sheer difficulty of making a living as an artist is just one of the reasons Tsiolkas is one of the creatives supporting the Save Our Arts campaign, alongside others including playwright Suzie Miller, actor Rhys Muldoon, and authors Tim Winton and Charlotte Wood. Suzie Miller, one of the supporters of Save Our Arts, won best new play at the 2023 Olivier Awards for Prima Facie. (Supplied: Sarah Hadley) The campaign — which is not led by any arts body, but by a disparate group of organisers who are passionate about the arts — hopes to put arts policy and funding onto the agenda ahead of the upcoming federal election. It's the successor to Fund the Arts, which ran ahead of the 2022 federal election, and contributed to the government's as-yet-unfulfilled commitment to local content quotas for streamers, and $280 million in additional arts funding. Academic and Save Our Arts policy adviser Dr Ben Eltham says Australian arts and culture is ""at a crossroads"". ""We're seeing lots of trends away from Australian art and culture and content and towards international tech giants, tech billionaires, making the decisions about the sort of music, art, literature, culture, that local audiences get to see and enjoy."" Last year, Charlotte Wood, a supporter of Save Our Arts, was the first Australian shortlisted for the Booker in 10 years. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin/Carly Earl) He points to music and screen-streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix as examples. Unlike local broadcasters, they do not have to meet Australian content quotas. ""The risk here is that we're going to end up back in the kind of 60s, back in the era before Whitlam, where Australian culture was an outpost; where all the decisions were made in foreign capitals by foreign corporations; and where, for Australian artists to have a career, they have to leave Australia,"" Eltham says. ""And you're already seeing a lot of Australian artists, particularly musicians, moving to say, LA. Because that's where the industry is."" Amyl and the Sniffers are among the Australian artists who have moved overseas to build their careers. (Supplied: Virgin Music/John Angus Stewart) It's a stark shift away from what Eltham describes as a kind of Australian cultural boom in the 00s. ""It's a real shame, and it's a real worry,"" he says. ""There was a period when you could almost say Australian art and culture was taking over the world. ""You had these incredible actors moving to Hollywood and smashing it. You had Australian novelists winning the Booker. You had Australian music getting massive all over the world. You had Australian visual artists being internationally influential."" Save Our Arts wants to revitalise Australia's cultural industries through the creation of 200 creative fellowships for emerging artists; an extra $10 million for the Translation Fund for Literature; and $5 billion over 10 years for a cultural infrastructure fund for Australia's galleries, theatres, cultural hubs and libraries. Save Our Arts was inspired to advocate for the establishment of more creative fellowships by universal basic income for artists in Ireland. (Pictured: Save Our Arts supporter Tim Winton.) (Supplied: Denise Winton) The collective intends to campaign in federal seats during the election, through social media and community outreach, putting pressure on political parties to adopt its suggested initiatives. The campaign would like to see the government legislate an AI Act to protect the copyright and intellectual property of Australians, including a stamp that clearly shows a work has been ""Made by Humans"". ""That's the sort of thing that actually could be pursued by government, and that governments already do with other types of accreditation and labelling, for example, of organic produce in the agricultural sector,"" Eltham explains. ""We were told that AI would do the drudgery work, and it would free us up to have more free time. Instead, what it seems to be doing is stealing the jobs of artists and making billionaires richer."" Save Our Arts also advocates for a quota of 20 per cent Australian content on streaming platforms, with streamers who fail to meet that quota paying a levy that would fund arts and cultural projects. In addition, a ""Koala stamp"" would indicate Australian content on Spotify and Netflix. In 2021, the Bureau of Communications, Arts and Regional Research found Australian movies and TV shows accounted for less than 2 per cent of Netflix's local catalogue. (Pictured: Anna Torv in Netflix's Territory.) (Supplied: Netflix) The final request is for production offsets — as used in the screen sector — to be extended to other areas of the arts, specifically for new Australian work, and for an insurance fund for the music and performing arts industries. ""You get a production offset for making a TV show or movie in Australia, but you don't get anything at all for putting on a festival,"" Eltham says. ""The music industry has got a big insurance problem, and rising costs. But they also have falling audiences, and one of the problems there is that local audiences don't want to go to see local acts. Why? Because they don't know about them."" Falling audiences can also be linked to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, he says, with many Australians struggling to make ends meet. ""I would argue that it's even more important in a cost-of-living crisis that governments step up to provide culture free of charge,"" Eltham says. ""It's why public art is so important; public culture; public libraries."" Tsiolkas says it's much harder to sustain yourself as an artist now than when he was starting out. The first print run of Loaded was 6,000. When the film adaptation Head On premiered in 1998, the book's sales went up to more than 30,000. (Supplied: Penguin) ""I feel like I'm part of a really lucky generation,"" he says. ""These days, housing is so much more expensive, health is so much more expensive, and education is so much more expensive."" Tsiolkas benefited from government support at the beginning of his career. His publisher, Vintage Books, received a publishing subsidy of $2,718 towards production costs for his first novel, Loaded (1995), and, eight years later, Tsiolkas received a Literature Board Grant for Established Writers. ""It was important to get support, whether from grants or from organisations like Writers Victoria. They took what I wanted to do seriously and were able to help with the matter-of-fact things, like paying your bills, paying rent or the mortgage, paying the groceries,"" he says. ""We need to make it so people are not worried how they're going to pay the grocery bill every single day of their life. He says the issue of subsistence for artists is tied to class — and who gets to make art. ""[We] need to take class seriously,"" Tsiolkas says. ""One of the things that's hardest to fight against is a notion that being an artist or being a writer is a really bougie thing; that it's something that only a certain group of people in society can do. ""That's absolutely not true, but it is a lot harder to do if you come from a working-class background, or you come from communities that have been, for a long time, ignored or under-represented in the arts.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-20/save-our-arts-campaign-christos-tsiolkas-rhys-muldoon-tim-winton/104836982
Australian retirees sitting on their super rather than spending it,"Australians need government help to spend super, argues the Grattan Institute",2025-01-20 15:07:18,"Australians need government help to spend their superannuation in retirement, to stop the savings system ending up as ""a massive inheritance scheme"", the Grattan Institute warns. A report into superannuation by the think tank finds few retirees draw down on their super as intended. It highlights that many retirees are net savers, with their super balances growing for decades after they retire, for fear of outliving their savings. ""This is not how it was meant to be. Too few retirees are enjoying the benefits of the savings they built up during their working lives,"" report author Brendan Coates says. ""You're asking people to draw down their savings when they don't know how long they're going to live. ""You don't know if you should be drawing 4.5 or 6 per cent a year because you've got a 20 per cent chance of dying before the age of 80, and a 20 per cent chance of living to 94."" Grattan Institute finds people aren't spending super as intended The report argues that after being guided through the superannuation system during their working lives, retirees are then left in the dark with little help in how to manage their super balances, with about 80 per cent of Australians finding retirement planning complicated. ""The little guidance retirees currently receive is unhelpful — it steers them only into account-based pensions, which require them to manage their spending to avoid the risk of outliving their savings,"" Dr Coates, the housing and economic security program director at Grattan, says. Grattan's modelling shows that Australians who draw down their super at the minimum rate when they retire will leave the equivalent of 65 per cent of their original super balance unspent by the age of 92. The think tank is calling on the federal government to offer all Australians the option of a lifetime annuity. Australia's super tax concessions will cost the government almost $60 billion in 2025-26, which is $9 billion more than expected. How can we afford it? An annuity is essentially a contract taken out for a fixed sum, which then pays you a regular, agreed income (usually monthly) for life and the payments are tax free, if super money is invested. According to ASIC's Moneysmart, the difference between account-based pensions and annuities is that the latter are less flexible, but provide a guarantee about future income, whereas account-based pensions can be affected by market returns. Grattan is advocating for retirees to be strongly encouraged to put 80 per cent of their super balance above $250,000 into a government annuity as a default option, saying such a reform could boost retirees' incomes by up to 25 per cent. As for those with balances below that level, the age pension would offer a minimum lifetime income. Despite there being a large private financial advice industry, the institute argues such prescriptive government measures are necessary. ""Relying on super funds to deliver annuities at scale is unlikely to work,"" the report states. ""Super funds have resisted previous attempts by government to get them to do so. Dr Coates believes few Australians buy annuities because they find it hard to trust that a private provider will offer them a good deal on a product they find it difficult to understand, whereas a government scheme would be likely to increase uptake. Small improvements in your superannuation's performance or fees can make a significant difference in retirement. He argues that administering such a scheme would cost taxpayers nothing. ""People would be using their super balances to buy the annuity, and the government would be managing those funds, and paying out the annuities from the pool of funds that comes from those annuity purchases.

Dutton can't dodge the spotlight — or his unresolved problems,Peter Dutton can't dodge the spotlight as the election draws closer — or his unresolved problems,2025-01-18 05:00:00,"Next week will see the first anniversary of the Albanese government's decision to redesign the Stage 3 tax cuts to ensure they were distributed across income levels, rather than just going to those on higher incomes. You can be sure, in the already fetid campaign environment, that the government will be not only wanting to remind people of that decision, but that Peter Dutton didn't back it. Anthony Albanese will give the ""traditional"" prime minister's address at the National Press Club on Friday — the day before the anniversary — and that must be more than a coincidence. We've already had a couple of weeks of elevated political activity and, despite the imminent inauguration of Donald Trump, upcoming ceasefire in Gaza and the steady rise in conspicuous and abhorrent anti-Semitism at home, there's been enough space in the media for at least some coverage of government announcements around the country. It's a change from last year, when Dutton was able to throw the government's plans off course, and populate the headlines, with stories about unleashed criminals or banning Palestinians trying to escape Gaza. In 2024, the opposition leader was able to drop these hand grenades and then largely disappear from the media for a week at a time. Peter Dutton delivers his pitch to become prime minister Now it's an election year and that's not so easy. He joined the fray last Sunday at a ""Coalition Campaign Rally"" in Melbourne and has since been out and about in the Melbourne seats of Aston, Kooyong, in the Tasmanian seat of Lyons, and the Queensland seat of Blair. He's been armed with policy announcements that are minuscule and feel a little, well, 2019, with a heavy touch of law and order thrown in. For example, $15,000 to install security cameras in a Tasmanian town. It's the sort of policy beloved of Coalition governments from Howard to Morrison. But which often smacks of the sort of thing that is more suitably in the sphere of a local council. Political fortunes can quickly turn and this week Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has been a conspicuous visitor to Victoria. Dutton has done more of these sorts of appearances — and the associated ""doorstop"" interviews — this week than he has in a long time. The doorstops are more a hotchpotch of local questions and questions phoned in from Canberra than the more focused scrutiny you might get at a Canberra press conference, or even by appearing at the National Press Club, but the local journos are still doing their job. In Brighton, the opposition leader spoke of the local IGA supermarket, at which, he said, ""they're seeing customers every day who are changing their consumption patterns and the food that they're buying"". ""People are really feeling the cost of living pressures here in Tasmania and across the country. We want to make sure that we can help Australians, not hurt them. That's exactly what a Coalition government does"", he said. A journalist asked the obvious question: what would a Dutton government do to fix it? ""Well, as the Reserve Bank Governor has pointed out, inflation is what keeps interest rates higher for longer,"" he began not very persuasively. ""The energy policy of the government is what keeps the energy prices higher for longer … we need an energy policy which has downward pressure on prices."" An energy policy which put downward pressure on prices would certainly be applauded. But the Coalition's energy policy to date consists of a nuclear policy which (if it worked) would not see a new form of energy come on stream for decades and which will, in the meantime, involve taxpayers footing a bill for hundreds of billions of dollars. So no immediate price relief there. It has also spoken about increasing gas production, without indicating how it intends to do that amid the myriad roadblocks, often at a state or local community level, that have stopped it until now. There was also the usual stuff about cutting wasteful government spending, without specifying what that might be, which would ""put downward pressure on inflation"". Australian politicians taking to TikTok to campaign for federal election The unkind might summarise the Coalition's cost of living policy as non-existent, particularly when Dutton not only initially objected to the reconstructed tax cuts last year but also most of the cost of living relief that the government has introduced in areas like childcare and energy bills. He even doubled down this week, describing assistance to households as ""sugar hits"". ""If you have a look at the sugar hits, you can provide support to people and people appreciate some support, obviously — particularly for energy costs or other support that the government might provide — but people are smarter than that,"" he told the ABC's David Lipson. You can have the economic argument about the value of short-term subsidies. But we're talking politics here, and it is not clear just where the grand Coalition strategy is going on the cost of living. It feels for all the world like the Coalition is relying on the disgruntlement of voters with the government for what really are very tough times for a lot of people, rather than actively producing serious policies to do anything about it. A Coalition source said this week that cost of living was not an issue on which the Opposition has any advantage, so it is better off playing to its, and particularly Dutton's, strengths: issues like law and order, and culture war issues like Australia Day. But there is also disgruntlement within the Coalition about what is seen as Dutton avoiding, or not properly engaging in, the economic debate, and with his shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor. Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Some believe Dutton is just not comfortable talking economics. Whether he is, or isn't, there is increasing frustration among some of his colleagues that he needs to be doing it. There are also inklings of concern about the opposition leader's tendency to overstep the mark, or make mistakes, when under pressure: something his lack of media appearances for the past two and a half years has meant hasn't necessarily been conspicuous. The Coalition's nuclear policy is deeply vulnerable on its costings and technical viability; his political judgement on the tax cut issue questionable; he has had to walk back claims or promises because he's got the numbers wrong — as he did on migration figures last year. Until now, there's been a solid answer to that: ""whatever he's doing is working, so who cares"". But this week has given us a foretaste of how the political dynamics change in an election year. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     So far, Dutton's refusal, or inability, to undertake a reshuffle of his frontbench has largely gone under the radar, despite the fact he has to replace two very senior colleagues in Simon Birmingham and Paul Fletcher. The brawling between factions, and particularly the struggle for control by conservatives (which is manifesting itself publicly in the push by Tony Abbott and others to try to install Warren Mundine in Fletcher's seat of Bradfield) has made settling the question of whether Voice supporter Julian Leeser comes back to the front bench very fraught. Election policies still being considered by the shadow expenditure review committee with an election imminent also makes it hard to dump frontbenchers who have developed those policies. From Anthony Albanese's perspective, all those unresolved problems only make it more attractive to bring Parliament back next month, and let them be exposed to some national capital light.

Liberal Senate candidate faces vote to be disendorsed,Liberal Senate candidate faces vote to be disendorsed over claims of branch stacking,2025-01-17 10:56:16,"The Liberals lead Senate candidate for Canberra faces a vote to be disendorsed after being called in for a meeting over claims of branch stacking. Liberal Party members, not authorised to speak on the record, have told the ABC Liberal candidate Jacob Vadakkedathu was called in for a meeting with three senior party officials on Thursday, who told him there was evidence the Indian business community leader had signed up allies in order to win pre-selection for the Senate ticket. A petition was circulated among members after concerns the pre-selection vote had been influenced, with a call to hold a new pre-selection vote within 25 days. That was handed to Liberal branch president Nick Tyrrell with the necessary signatures, and Mr Vadakkedathu was encouraged on Thursday to step down or else the party would proceed with that vote. On Friday morning, Mr Tyrrell informed members a new vote would be held to pre-select Senate candidates for the ACT. ""Calling this Council meeting was not done lightly,"" an email seen by the ABC reads. ""As difficult as this issue may be to discuss and resolve, I have an obligation as president to follow the constitution, and it is clear in this instance. ""No matter your view on the petition or the issues it requires us to discuss as an organisation, I know that every one of us is driven by a desire to see Peter Dutton become Prime Minister later this year."" When the ABC contacted Mr Vadakkedathu for comment, he responded: ""These are internal party matters and I have no comments to make. Thank you."" The party will now hold a new ballot on February 1 to pre-select Senate candidates in time for an election before mid-May. It is not unlawful to recruit people into a branch of a political party in order to influence candidate selection — known as branch stacking. However the ACT Liberal branch is easier to influence than others, requiring a comparatively short three-month qualification period and attendance at one branch meeting in order to be able to vote to pre-select candidates. The Liberal Party lost its Senate seat in the ACT, held by Zed Seselja, to independent David Pocock at the 2022 election.

The clock is ticking on Peter Dutton's 'gentle giant' rebrand,"Peter Dutton is trying to change his 'strongman' image, but who is it for?",2025-01-16 05:17:09,"It's not the usual sea of blue you'd be hoping to see over summer, but that's a federal election year for you. On Sunday, facing a crowd clad in cobalt Liberal tees in Melbourne's Mount Waverley, Peter Dutton launched into his pitch for voters at the coming federal election. Time to get back on track. Law and order. Housing. Secure, safe, united: strong. Strong, strong, strong. Seeking to put himself in contrast to the man he described as one of the country's ""weakest ever"" prime ministers, Peter Dutton has once again found himself on well trodden ground. Peter Dutton delivers his pitch to become prime minister The opposition leader is well known for his ""tough guy"" persona, developed off the back of years as a police officer and later as immigration and home affairs minister. So well in fact, that it's an image he's been trying to reshape in high production Liberal Party videos complete with gentle tinkling music about ""the real Peter Dutton"". At the last election the Coalition lost a number of seats it had held for generations, primarily to a group of women running as ""teal"" independents. They were swept into parliament on a platform of integrity, climate change action and, importantly, gender equality with many voters saying they were sick of blokes engaging in ""strongman"" politics. These teal electorates are in the sights of the Coalition as they try to win government in the coming months, so why the big, strong man routine? There's an often repeated saying that in politics the left is ""mummy"" and the right is ""daddy"" (no, not in that way.) When society is stable socially and economically, voters are more open to a gentler, softer left leaning government: mum. When times are harder and uncertain, the electorate gravitates to the right in search of a protector to tough out difficult times: dad. Trite gender stereotypes aside, looking at the approach of the Coalition and their leader over recent months begs the question: is Peter Dutton gunning to be both? He's repeatedly referred to Anthony Albanese as weak, Australia as un-unified and repeatedly attempted to reignite culture wars around flags and ceremonies he canvassed in 2024. Peter Dutton spruiks importance of family at rally in Melbourne At the same time, throughout his speech at Sunday's rally he repeatedly referred to women and children — specifically about their safety. As we head into the election campaign proper, it appears he's trying to keep the strongman persona but with a softened, protector element that hasn't been at forefront much before. Cultivating the image of, as one person describes him in the video The Peter Dutton We Know, a gentle giant. With the Coalition rolling the dice on Strongman: the remix, how might this be received in the inner city seats they lost last time around? Peter Dutton and his team have been also been attempting to soften the tough persona for some time, like in this profile piece in a 2019 edition of the Courier-Mail. As much as campaigners, MPs and political journalists try to get an accurate sense of ""the vibe"" in various electorates, sadly we're yet to actually develop psychic powers. But, instead of looking at a crystal ball let's look at one of the longest running studies tracking voter behaviour: the Australian Election Study, run by the ANU. The AES shows that since the 1990s, women have been less likely to vote conservative than men. And since 2019 the Coalition has lost support among university-educated and higher income voters. Essentially, the very kind of person that lives in the very teal seats Liberal campaigners say they want to win back this year. But those on the opposition benches and out door knocking insist they're in with a real shot to flip the teal seats. They're banking on cost-of-living concerns having overtaken worry about climate change, saying memories of the fires of Black Summer are no longer at the front of voters' minds like they were in 2022. Due to the global nature of the insurance industry, the costs of the LA fires may be felt in Australia.  Though with wildfires continuing to rage in LA, that's not an expectation shared by their teal opponents. As for the strongman messaging? Well, they're optimistic that after punishing the Coalition in 2022 teal supporters will come back into the Liberal fold they occupied for decades before. After all, they say, these are the electorates that helped deliver a victory for the ultimate Liberal macho man: Tony Abbott. But here's the rub, according to the Australian election study the people who swept teals to victory are not those people. Instead, it was more left-aligned voters who cast their ballots with the specific aim of turfing Liberal MPs. ""The view that teal voters are ""disaffected Liberals"" protesting the policies of their party …applies to less than one in five Teal voters,"" researchers said. ""In contrast, by far the largest group are tactical voters who see their preferred party as non-viable … this is a level of tactical voting which far exceeds that found in most international studies."" One teal MP, on the condition of anonymity, said while a rise in crimes such as burglaries in some areas were absolutely a concern, that was not translating to support for the Coalition at a federal level. ""Speaking to people out doorknocking, they're very concerned about it,"" she said. ""But posturing doesn't make people feel safe, it makes them feel less secure because they see it as weaponising the issue and that puts people off."" Teal MPs, from left, Allegra Spender, Monique Ryan, Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney, Zali Steggall speaking at Parliament House (ABC News: Matt Roberts) She also pointed to another factor in this increasingly complicated equation: these former blue-ribbon seats are getting younger. Not just because more renters are moving into newly built apartments but because many young people can't afford to move out of their family home. ""Twenty to 30 years ago, these people would've been renting in [inner city suburbs], now they can't,"" she said, noting the group seemed to be particularly put off by the ""name calling"" between the leaders of the two major parties. If the Australian Election Study is anything to go by, that's bad news for the Liberals. It found the Coalition has very little support among Millennials and Generation Z. ""The Coalition's share of the vote fell in almost every age group, but especially among the youngest cohorts of voters."" According to those working on flipping seats blue, there are 21 target seats on their list. Four of them are held by teal independents: Melbourne's Kooyong and Goldstein along with Sydney's Wentworth and Mackellar. Currently they need to win 20 seats to secure the 75 needed for a majority government. This is presuming they hold on to seats like Bradfield, where independent Nicolette Boele narrowly missed out on unseating departing moderate Liberal MP Paul Fletcher. The seat is now on a thin margin of 2.5 per cent the Coalition's way, thanks to redistribution. But Dutton's launch on Sunday in the Melbourne seat of Chisholm underscores his side's main strategy: targeting those in the outer suburbs who are struggling under the weight of the rising cost of, well, everything. Among the seats the Coalition will be targeting are Robertson on the NSW Central Coast (currently held by ER doctor Gordon Reid on a margin of 2.2 per cent) and Bennelong on Sydney's lower north shore where Jerome Laxale is the only the second Labor MP to have represented the electorate. Also on the list are the Queensland Greens-held seats Brisbane (3.7 per cent) and Ryan (2.6 per cent) along with Labor's Blair (5.2 per cent). But even if the Coalition manages to defend all of its seats and flip all 16 Labor and Greens seats on its target list, it will still need to win back all four teal seats in its sights. Most vulnerable are Kooyong's Monique Ryan on a margin of 2.2 per cent in her Melbourne seat, where she's facing a challenge from Liberal Amelia Hamer. If the Coalition can't win back these four teal seats, that may leave them facing a big question: Can the strongman negotiate a minority government?",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-16/peter-dutton-politics-campaign-teal-strategy/104821352
"Dutton makes case to become PM, rallying Liberal faithful at launch","Dutton makes case to become PM, rallying Liberal faithful at launch",2025-01-12 12:51:47,"Liberal leader Peter Dutton has made his case to become prime minister, rallying the party faithful at an event in Melbourne, where the Coalition must make in-roads to win back government at the federal election. The Coalition hopes to make the Albanese government the first one-term government in almost a century, and has eaten away at Labor's popularity over the past 12 months, according to polling trends. In his first speech of the year at a Liberal event in Mount Waverley, in Melbourne's east, Mr Dutton laid out his party's priorities if it can win this year's election: fighting cost of living pressures, supporting small business, establishing nuclear power, improving housing supply, ""rebalancing"" migration levels, lifting general practitioner numbers, a tougher approach to crime and a closer relationship with Israel. And in an attempt to cut the head off any prospective ""Medi-scare"" campaign, Mr Dutton also committed to strengthening Medicare under his leadership. In an homage to president-elect Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"", Mr Dutton stood in front of a podium stamped with ""Get Australia Back on Track""— directly lifted from his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon's campaign. Peter Dutton said fighting cost of living would be a priority under a government he leads. (AAP: Diego Fedele) Borrowing from Trump's successful campaign playbook, Mr Dutton asked voters to consider the past three years, and whether they could ""afford"" another term of Labor government. ""I think the past three years are a good indication of what the future will look like under a returned Labor government,"" Mr Dutton said. ""A returned Labor government — in majority or minority — will see setbacks set in stone. ""A newly elected Coalition government is a last chance to reverse the decline."" Mr Dutton told supporters he had seen the mood of Australians change under the current government to become more pessimistic and anxious, and the nation less safe and less cohesive. He said a Coalition government would turn that around by re-energising the economy. Last week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began visiting seats in northern Australia in an early campaign blitz, where he sought to paint Mr Dutton as a leader who was pessimistic and sought to divide Australians. Mr Albanese repeatedly raised instances of commitments Mr Dutton had made and later walked back, including a commitment to hold a second referendum on Indigenous recognition in the constitution. Speaking after the Liberal rally, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones warned Medicare was not safe under a Coalition government, despite Mr Dutton's commitment to it in his speech. ""Believe me, if Peter Dutton becomes the prime minister of Australia after this election, he will repeat what he did in government and destroy Medicare,"" Mr Jones said. ""This election will be a referendum on Medicare."" Outside the rally, a small crowd of protesters voiced their disapproval of Mr Dutton's plan to establish nuclear power in Australia through seven plants to be built over several decades. A small group of protesters outside the Liberal rally rejected the party's proposal to establish nuclear power in Australia. (ABC News: Leanne Wong) The Liberal campaign launch sets the scene for a contest this year that will focus on inflation and the deterioration in affordability and living standards for Australians over recent years. The pathway for each party to govern in their own right with a majority looks incredibly narrow, setting up a fierce fight over key seats mostly in NSW and Victoria. Labor could be forced into minority government if it loses just three seats, while the Coalition must pick up 21 if it wants to govern with a majority. For the Coalition to reclaim government after just a single term in opposition, it will also have to make inroads in Victoria, where it holds only nine of the 39 seats in the second-largest state. The Coalition is eyeing seats in Aston and Chisholm, where the rally was held, as two seats it hopes to win after losing Chisholm in 2022 and Aston in a by-election in 2023.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-12/dutton-liberal-campaign-launch-federal-election/104808428
Community desperate for investment welcomes $30m 'game changer',"'Forgotten' Wyndham welcomes federal pledge to open port, boost infrastructure",2025-01-11 09:21:14,"Community leaders in Western Australia's northernmost town have welcomed a $30 million federal government cash splash, with hopes upgrades to Wyndham's town site and port can ""drag it into the 21st century"". With a federal election looming, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese embarked on a whirlwind tour of the country's north this week, stopping in the East Kimberley town of Kununurra. While the majority of Thursday's $200 million funding announcement was dedicated to alleviating WA's dire housing shortage, the town of Wyndham — 3,000km north of Perth — received almost $30 million for infrastructure upgrades. Along with $19.6 million for a new community hub and $13.2 million for a boat launching facility, the port has been given the federal seal of approval for First Point of Entry (FPOE) status. Wyndham Port has been granted First Point of Entry status.

Cambridge Gulf Limited (CGL) operates the Wyndham port and is the town's biggest employer, however local products such as the burgeoning cotton industry are exported from Darwin. There are hopes FPOE status will transform the Kimberley's ability to export produce closer to home, supercharging the local economy. ""For cotton exports they need empty containers to come in,"" Mr Albanese said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used a visit to Kununurra to announce $200 million worth of funding for WA housing and infrastructure. (ABC Kimberley: Giulia Bertoglio) CGL chief executive and Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley deputy president Tony Chafer said FPOE status could ""unlock the port's potential"". ""It's a game changer.

(ABC Kimberley: Giulia Bertoglio) Mr Chafer said the shire had been negotiating with the WA government for funding to implement the required FPOE infrastructure upgrades. ""We'll just have to wait and see what the next step is,"" he said. ""I'd hope we can start infrastructure upgrades this year. ""Even though we have FPOE status, that doesn't come into effect until we have the infrastructure to deal with any biosecurity threats."" A spokesperson for WA Ports Minister David Michael said the state government welcomed the FPOE status and ""looked forward to working with federal agencies towards implementation"".

A week of signals for the wild way politics might unfold in 2025,Albanese's Bruce Highway announcement got as a good a response as he could've hoped for — and not a virtue signal in sight,2025-01-11 04:00:00,"If you were constructing your federal election bingo card, the first thing you would put it on it at every election — for at least several of the last decades — would be ""The Bruce Highway"". The 1,700 kilometre-long artery that connects Queensland's south-east to the far north is still, in equal measure, a lousy, often treacherous piece of road and a regular stop for politicians to announce spending decisions to fix bits of it. One thing you can definitely say about the Bruce Highway — and improving it — is it's not ""woke"". It's not an ""elitist issue"", or even part of the ""progressive agenda of affluent elites"". Another thing you can say about it is that our current prime minister could bore for Australia on almost every inch of the road. Anthony Albanese's opening gambit for 2025 — a year in which an election is due to be held no later than May 17 — underscores the importance of the nation's northern jurisdictions to the coming contest. Anthony Albanese is a former infrastructure minister and maintains a freakish level of knowledge of intersections, roundabouts, truck laybys and overtaking lanes, and the history of funding and development proposals for them. Woe betide the journalist travelling with him this week who sought to challenge him on some particular bit of road funding history. Here was a man totally confident on his turf and brooking no smarty pants. Albanese's start to his 2025 election campaign came as Justin Trudeau's prime ministership hit the fence and Elon Musk became the world's biggest political oxygen thief by buying into UK politics and that of Germany. Cue lots of reflections on how Trudeau was just the latest ""virtue signaller"" political leader to fall from grace, and the ominous warnings that spelt for Albanese. Musk's increasingly erratic interventions in European politics signalled the wild way politics might unfold in 2025. But all of it only served to highlight how ""bread and butter"" has been the PM's start to his year. The only virtues he was signalling were that a better road may in time save hundreds of lives. Having agreed to break his government's own policy of only funding roads with the states on a 50/50 basis and agreeing to stump up $7.2 billion — or 80 per cent of the estimated total cost of upgrading the road — the prime minister even got the enthusiastic endorsement for the announcement of still very new Queensland LNP Premier David Crisafulli. For such a big announcement, everyone seemed a little vague about how exactly the spending would unfold. The PM said on Monday that the announcement ""we were planning to make was put in the Mid-Year Economic Forecast"" (that is, it was accounted for in the mid-year budget update last month). Finance Minister Katy Gallagher told 7.30 on Wednesday that the cost ""will be reflected in the next budget update, as they come into those forward estimates years"". Elon Musk's increasingly erratic interventions in European politics signalled the wild way politics might unfold in 2025. (Reuters: Brandon Bell/Pool) These statements could both well be true: any road project — particularly the series of individual projects involved in fixing the Bruce Highway — takes a really long time (though Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said this week that she would like to see it completed by the time of the Brisbane Olympics in 2032). That means there may well be some funding put aside already in the budget for the next four years, and then the rest of it will be funded ""beyond the forwards"", as they say in budget land. But as of Friday afternoon, getting clarity on just how much would be spent was rather difficult. Crisafulli says he will be bringing forward the state government's own spending on the highway. It will ultimately be up to the state government to decide where the money is spent and in what order. The Bruce Highway was put on Infrastructure Australia's priority list in 2016 and IA appears to have since assessed around 10 different projects along the highway for merit (albeit being somewhat lukewarm about some). The Queensland government is now setting up a different advisory council to determine priorities, a council which the premier says is going to be there to ""take the politics"" out of decision making. It's all a bit nerdy and uninteresting, unless you happen to live along the Bruce Highway. There was a rare broad-based endorsement of the decision from various Queensland stakeholders this week. The exception was the federal opposition, which seemed to have several positions on the announcement running roughly from Peter Dutton's reported endorsement of it (""we thought of it first"") to Angus Taylor suggesting the Coalition would want to make its own decisions and, besides, the budget can't really afford it anyway. The Coalition seems to be concentrating its efforts on communicating on social media, including via Peter Dutton's Instagram account. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore) For a government that's not exactly flavour of the month in the Sunshine State, it was as good a response as you could have hoped for. The significant part of it, though, is that it sounds like work will start sooner rather than later, meaning it is not just another one of those promises politicians make and are never heard of again. It was equally striking that as Albanese then ventured into the Northern Territory and Western Australia, it was to announce projects — particularly in housing infrastructure and community housing — that had started or were literally going to start straight away. ""Sod turning"" was a regular phrase on the trail. A PM more regularly associated with inner-city Sydney was also out on cattle stations and announcing new facilities to allow international trade from ports in the north west. All in all, it wasn't so much pork barrelling promises as trying to demonstrate that the government was actually doing things. ""Virtue signalling"" — for which many would read the Indigenous Voice to Parliament as a conspicuous example — was nowhere to be seen. Annabel Crabb Jacob Greber     What was Peter Dutton doing in the meantime? The Coalition seems to be concentrating its efforts on communicating via social media — for example, in an Instagram post from the opposition leader in which he talks through five policies he says voters might not have heard about. These were restoring 20 psychology sessions to Medicare; a $5 billion housing infrastructure fund; rebalancing migration; more GPs to outer suburbs and ""our zero emission nuclear energy policy"". There wasn't exactly a lot of detail. If there was any virtue signalling going on this week, it was signalling of a very different nature as yet another tussle for the conservative control of the Liberal Party erupted, this time in NSW. The prime minister looked at ease during his hot run of Australia's north this week — proof, perhaps, that summer is his best season. Former prime minister Tony Abbott wrote a glowing reference for repeat Liberal Party candidate (and former ALP national president) Warren Mundine to contest the seat of Bradfield on Sydney's North Shore after frontbencher Paul Fletcher announced his retirement from politics. The seat is widely expected to go to an independent ""teal"" candidate. Abbott described Mundine as ""the national hero who helped to lead the fight against Labor's divisive Voice"". ""In the face of a green-left Labor government that's broken promises and is in thrall to the climate cult and identity politics, we really owe it to the Australian people to demonstrate that we can be a steady, sensible, and strong alternative committed to lower taxes, greater freedom and smaller government but above all deeply patriotic and passionately Australian,"" Abbott said. It might be a message that appeals to parts of the Liberal base — though Abbott's intervention has only further riled moderates angry over his interventions in Victoria. But it's not clear how the voters of Bradfield (who are already seen as likely to vote teal) will feel about a candidate backed by someone who speaks of ""the climate cult"".

Albanese looks revived in the heat as he resets his election pitch,"From 'no Australian left behind' to 'no Australian held back', Albanese resets election pitch",2025-01-10 11:11:43,"It's north of 40 degrees Celsius. The humidity is thick. Even beneath a tree at Lake Nash — one of the nation's (and perhaps even the world's) biggest continuous cattle stations, a few dozen kilometres from the NT border — the heat feels oppressive. For mal-adapted cool-climate southerners such as this correspondent, it's like someone wrapped a scalding wet sleeping bag over your head. Every minute in the open feels like an hour. You think you can handle it, but there's just a touch of panic at the thought of having no nearby access to an air-conditioned refuge. But the prime minister is revelling in it. Running an early January hot lap of the north, taking in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Dashing from town to town, doorstop to doorstop, media interview to media interview. Proof perhaps that summer is his best season. Certainly, the man himself seems to be revived after a tough 2024 that ended with a polling slump that has Labor strategists nervous about the coming election campaign. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Rockhampton on Tuesday, January 2025, visiting the under construction Rockhampton Ring Road project. (ABC News: Aaron Kelly) He has shed the pallor, the hard-etched look of stress that comes to everyone in the job. While he has still got a lot of heavy political baggage — cost-of-living crises are indifferent incumbency killers — this week's northern exposure has given him a lift. He has shone a light on Peter Dutton's absence and filled the traditional summer media void with his own messages. While some critics mutter that he is doing it out of desperation, talking to Australians during their summer repose when they have more time to consider what he's saying, is not the worst idea. At Kununurra's ""Kimberley Grande"" bar — the only pub in town that's open in what is currently the tourism off-season across the Top End — crowds of locals surround Albanese for a yarn. The mood is warm. Polite. They don't vote Labor much in these parts, but they also don't get to see sitting prime ministers all that often either. And for a PM looking for a way to keep his majority, such scenes are not nothing. Anthony Albanese drinks with locals at the Kimberley Grande in Kununurra. (ABC News: Jacob Greber) This week's biggest splash was announcing $7.2 billion for upgrades to the Bruce Highway and more money for infrastructure and housing in the NT and WA's north. Every night, TV news has beamed in images of the PM out and about. Looking at road projects, mustering cattle, and inland dams. The locations he's chosen to launch his unofficial re-election campaign are not natural Labor habitat. Some, like Kununurra and Mount Isa are tiger country, politically speaking. But by going there, Albanese is keen to demonstrate he's thinking about the whole country. Not just heartland suburban electorates. There is unlikely to be much of a local dividend, in terms of seats won, but it sends a broader signal: Dutton isn't here, but I am. There's no doubt last year ended poorly for the Albanese government. Ministers were over it. Faces drawn. Despite finishing the parliamentary year on a high with a flurry of legislative success, there was a palpable sense of weariness. Doubts were expressed about Albanese's salesmanship. Public and private polls showed he had a net negative rating worse than Dutton's. Any thought that the mid-year budget update — delivered just before Christmas — might turn the mood were dashed in a flood of negative headlines about deficits and spending. Albanese shrugs off those fears. ""We will win a majority,"" he tells ABC news. The party is united, he insists, like never before. Are there any threats to your leadership, he's asked in his first sit-down TV interview of the year, sweltering under that cattleman's tree. ""Not at all,"" he says. ""I've been in the parliament for a while now. I have never seen a political party as united, as cohesive and as determined as the Australian Labor Party is going into 2025."" A new year campaigning blitz has intensified election speculation, but the PM appeared relaxed about parliament's February return in his first interview of the year. The PM is keeping his plans for when the election will be called close to his chest. And after nearly five days with the PM and his team, there's no overwhelming sense that it's imminent. For one thing, Albanese has a close and hopeful eye on whether the Reserve Bank will begin a long-awaited interest rate cutting cycle in mid-February. It would be a game changer. For him, and long-suffering households. And he told the ABC on Wednesday that he still has legislation to pass when parliament is scheduled to return early next month. Production tax credits for the mining industry to boost production of critical minerals and rare earths is at the top of his list. But if he does decide it's worth dashing to the polls early, he's already laid the groundwork to hit the ground running. This week's campaign is all about showing his own side that he's — in the words of one inside observer — ""willing to do things a little differently to shake this 'sleepwalking into oblivion' narrative"". It's been about road-testing what will be Labor's central selling points. Investments in infrastructure like the 1,600-kilometre Bruce Highway, cheaper access to Medicare, and more potential cost-of-living relief in the form of energy rebates. Unlike Dutton, he says, Labor has a big agenda to set the country up for the future, with a big emphasis on the green energy transformation, critical minerals developments and boosting manufacturing. At the same time, the Albanese government has been quietly planting the foundations of an economic revolution, one that will see the creation — Labor hopes — of a new political constituency that can offset losses from some of its traditional blue-collar union base, particularly in the construction sector. Built around the ""care economy"", Labor is seeking to expand aged care and childcare and continue its support of the NDIS. All have huge social dividends, and significant budget costs. But less appreciated is that they would also expand Labor's natural political constituency. While hiring more public servants tends to grow Labor-friendly numbers in places like Canberra and the major cities, the new growth is in a workforce that looks after the disabled, the young and the old that is distributed across every suburb and town around the nation. And unlike Dutton's nuclear energy plan, which Albanese gleefully notes will mean — according to the Coalition's own analysis — that the country will have a significantly smaller economy by 2050 than otherwise forecast, Labor's plans are having an immediate impact. ""I think if we get this decade right, we can set Australia up for the many decades ahead,"" Albanese tells the ABC. The prime minister will likely take the foot off the accelerator over the next few days but is preparing to deliver a major address at the National Press Club ahead of Australia Day. This week of flights, mini-shuttles, doorstops overlooking iconic northern settings — Mt Isa's Glencore Mine on one day, Kununurra's Ord River scheme the next — has the look and feel of an election campaign. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese steps off his plane in Kununurra after arriving for his WA tour. January 2025. (ABC News: Giulia Bertoglio) Part of it is about getting his own team into gear for the long fight ahead. And to set up a contrast with Dutton, whom the prime minister repeatedly taunted this week for not being match fit, for shunning press conferences in front of the Canberra press gallery and avoiding challenging media outlets. On the prime minster's plane this week, alongside the ABC, the only other reporters to make the trip were from News Ltd's The Australian and state tabloids, as well as Kerry Stokes's The West Australian. Some senior figures inside Labor regard those outlets as the party's primary opposition, likely to cause them more damage than the opposition leader himself. Interestingly the PM still invites those organisations onto his plane, keenly aware how they link to a broader constituency beyond Labor's base. Dutton's media strategy over the past year has tended to stay on safer ground. And he's been willing to publicly attack media outlets he regards as hostile, including the ABC and Sydney Morning Herald, and cut them from early access to big announcements, opting to stick with more allied outlets. ""I've taken more questions off the Canberra press gallery here in Mount Isa this morning than Peter Dutton has taken off the Canberra press gallery in the last six months of last year,"" Albanese said on Wednesday, during a stop in the iconic mining town. Dutton is unlikely to remain quiet this January for long and is reportedly planning a rally in Melbourne at the weekend. But for now, Albanese has a hot head start on the biggest political contest of the year.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-10/albanese-resets-message-summer-refresh/104801740
Albanese enters this election 'kicking against the wind',Albanese is running at the election 'kicking against the wind' — and there's less room for error than usual,2025-01-10 04:00:00,"Anthony Albanese could have spent Christmas at home with his fiancé and his summer at the cricket. But he worked through it, and this week he packed his bags and travelled north on a week-long dry run, preparing to enter an election with the wind blowing against him. There is a common wisdom in Australian politics that an election campaign before Australia Day is doomed to fail — Australia has never held a federal election in January or February. Who wants to worry about politicians when there are much more pressing issues like reserving a spot on the beach with your oversized cabana? For Albanese, however, the fact that much of the country has switched off works just fine. Since Monday Albanese has been travelling northern Queensland, the NT and northern WA (with a pit-stop in Perth), uncommonly taking members of the press gallery with him for the trip. A new year campaigning blitz has intensified election speculation, but the PM appeared relaxed about parliament's February return in his first interview of the year. It's not simply a blitz to shore up seats that could make or break the election for Labor — the PM openly acknowledged while standing in Wide Bay it was not a ""target seat"" for Labor, nor was his visit to Kennedy, which is unassailably Katter country. It was about making him match fit for a better start to this election than the last one. In 2022, Albanese stumbled on day one when he could not say what the current Reserve Bank interest rate or national unemployment rate were, amid debate on rising inflation. The cringe-inducing gaffe was made worse by Albanese's defensive rebuke of journalists moments before, when he insisted he would not enter ""auctions"" on statistics, while also boasting his knowledge of the prices of petrol, bread and other household goods that had tripped up Scott Morrison. It cost him days of momentum on the campaign trail. Peter Dutton has a reputation for being better at keeping on message and dodging questions that might trip up other politicians. But the PM, speaking from Dutton's home state of Queensland, was eager to point out some of the opposition leader's looser moments, like when he was open to localised tax rates. Speaking in at-risk Labor seat Lingiari in the Northern Territory, he made sure to mention Dutton's walked-back promise to hold a second referendum on constitutional recognition. And he heckled Dutton for taking fewer questions at press conferences with Canberra's press gallery over the last six months than Albanese had done in a single day from Mt Isa. Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton is expected to hold a campaign-style rally in Melbourne this weekend. (AAP: Russell Freeman) ""He's not doing any hard press conferences, he has done one press conference in Canberra over many, many months. He did it at 1:50pm because he knows Question Time starts at 2pm — took two questions,"" Albanese jabbed.  ""I'll continue to be held to account. He needs to be held to account for these thought bubbles."" Albanese may be banking that a bit of summer practice will make sure it's his opponent, not him, who makes a day-one error this time. The prime minister has even less room for error than usual entering this election. In the lead up to 2022, a confident Albanese said Labor was ""kicking with the wind"" heading into that campaign. This time, they will be kicking against it. A global wave of anti-incumbency sentiment has toppled governments of all stripes, or eroded their margins. A loss of just three seats will force Labor into minority government — though the path to a majority government is not easy for the Coalition, which would need to pick up 21 seats. Analysis by pollsters RedBridge after an end-of-year redrawing of electorate boundaries suggests the chance that Labor can maintain a majority is near nil. They now predict the Coalition will be the largest bloc in parliament after this election, with somewhere between 64 to 78 seats to Labor's 59 to 71 seats, based on end of year polling. Even the prospect of that must be uncomfortable for a government who only recently won back power after nearly a decade of Coalition government. But it's not in Queensland — where Albanese has been rehearsing his stump speech — that the fight will be won or lost this time. With less than a year until the next election, the words of party elder Gough Whitlam could be ringing in Anthony Albanese's ears.  In fact, Redbridge expects not a single seat to change hands between Labor and the Coalition in that state (Labor, for its part, thinks it at least has a shot in Leichhardt where LNP veteran Warren Entsch is retiring). The erosion of Labor's vote over the year has put the Coalition in striking distance, and its best improvements have been where the fight is expected to be fiercest, in outer suburban and regional seats, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. Nearly all the seats looking too close to call are around Sydney or Melbourne and their outskirts — seats like Reid in Sydney's west, Dobell, Hunter and Robertson north of the city; like Chisholm and Aston in Melbourne, or McEwen to its north. Early in the term, Peter Dutton made clear he would not be focusing on old blue ribbon seats that turned to the teals as the Coalition's path back to government. If he has a way to make Albanese a one-term PM, it seems most likely through the suburbs and regional cities. The unabashed Queenslander is expected to hold a campaign-style rally in Melbourne's east on Sunday, where the Coalition wants to reclaim the seats of Aston and Chisholm. For Dutton, who said over the New Year there was ""no point going into this season believing you can only win next season’s grand final"", it seems he feels no dry run is needed.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-10/albanese-federal-election-kicking-against-wind-room-error/104791980
Albanese unveils $7.2b highway upgrade as election speculation looms,Federal Labor pledges to fund bulk of Bruce Highway upgrade in re-election bid,2025-01-06 12:42:28,"The federal government has announced it will fund the lion's share of $9 billion in Bruce Highway upgrades as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese kicks off his 2025 re-election pitch with a campaign blitz through Queensland, the NT and WA. In what is expected to be the first of a series of announcements this week aimed at critical seats Labor needs to win or retain, Mr Albanese will on Monday commit Labor to covering 80 per cent of the cost of raising the minimum safety level of the 1,673-kilometre road. The state's most critical transport infrastructure is notoriously dangerous, with an average fatal and serious injury crash rate of three to five times higher than any major highway in NSW or Victoria. Road safety experts have warned that fixing the Bruce Highway will likely have no ""end point"" despite the federal government announcing a major $7.2 billion upgrade. ""I've driven the Bruce Highway many times and I know the critical role it plays for Queenslanders, tourists and freight,"" Mr Albanese said. ""Today's announcement takes the total investment in the Bruce Highway to more than $17 billion … ""This is a special piece of highway. It's a dangerous piece of highway and it needs upgrading."" Mr Albanese's opening gambit for 2025 — a year in which an election is due to be held no later than May 17 — underscores the importance of the nation's northern jurisdictions to the coming contest. Federal Labor is desperate to claw back seats from the LNP in Queensland, where the Coalition is riding high after last year's state election win. In WA, the government is eager to retain the three seats it won in 2022 that helped Mr Albanese form a narrow majority. While not entirely unexpected, Mr Albanese's early January campaign push overturns the traditional political summer truce that normally sees both parties refraining from interrupting holidaying voters until after Australia Day. Mr Albanese is seeking to seize the Queensland public's attention early in the year (ABC News: Mark Moore) Instead, Mr Albanese is seeking to seize the public's attention early in the year, repeating last year's effort that saw Labor dominate the summer headlines with its plans to redistribute the stage 3 tax cuts. The early start will also fuel speculation Mr Albanese is planning to trigger an early election, potentially starting within weeks for a polling day in late February, though Labor strategists emphasise the prime minister has always vowed to go full term. On the road all week, Mr Albanese is expected to begin his northern odyssey with two days of visits to the Sunshine Coast, Rockhampton, Cairns and Mount Isa. During the second half of the week, he will spend time in the Kimberley and Perth. ""This election is a choice between building Australia's future or taking Australia backwards,"" Mr Albanese said in a statement supplied late on Sunday. ""My government cares about Australians. That's why we are delivering cost-of-living relief while strengthening Medicare and investing in infrastructure, child care and dignified aged care. ""Over the next three years, we can work together to build on the foundations we have laid."" The PM again refused to be drawn on the timing of the election, saying only that he would not call it ""this Sunday"". The Bruce Highway is notorious for the bad condition of its road surface. (ABC News: Russel Talbot/Facebook) As the primary road link between Cairns and Brisbane, the Bruce Highway ties together major regional centres including Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville, covering around 62 per cent of the Queensland population. Labor says $7.2 billion will ensure the road attains a minimum three-star safety rating, a system that tops out at five stars. The government says priority sections include Maryborough to Benaraby, Rockhampton to St Lawrence, Bowen to Townsville and Ingham to Innisfail. Money will be spent on installing safety barriers, wide centre lines, tactile line markings that give drivers auditory feedback, wider shoulder construction and increasing run-off areas, overtaking lanes and rest areas. There is also expected to be a focus on resealing and rehabilitating roads damaged by weather events. The potentially politically explosive overhaul is the first major shift in commonwealth-state land transport infrastructure funding arrangements since 2019. Labor's decision to fund 80 per cent of the Bruce Highway upgrades comes despite a push last year by federal Infrastructure Minister Catherine King to force states into a 50:50 funding split. ""There were 41 fatalities on the Bruce Highway in 2024. There's been two fatalities already in an accident this year. And that's why this is a priority, that's why we're singling out this highway above all others to receive 80 per cent funding rather than the 50 per cent that is standard,"" Mr Albanese said. Ms King said almost half the highway had a two-star rating. ""This historic investment answers the call of Queenslanders to bring the Bruce up to a three-star safety rating so Australians stop losing their loved ones on this road,"" Ms King said. ""We are providing a significant and long-term commitment to fixing the Bruce, and I call on the Queensland government to partner with us to get this done."" The Coalition's infrastructure spokesperson Bridget McKenzie said the Coalition had long campaigned for upgrades to the highway and welcomed the announcement, but was awaiting further details on exactly when and where the upgrades would be. ""We're absolutely committed to fix this highway, which is so necessary for not just regional Queensland, but indeed our export industries,"" she said. Senator McKenzie said the Coalition had already committed to restoring federal funding for the highway to 80 per cent, accusing Labor of ""cuts and delays"" in recent years. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said the Coalition had not settled its position on the funding and was awaiting detail. ""We want to see that it's genuine investment in upgrades of the Bruce Highway.""",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-06/federal-labor-to-fund-bruce-highway-upgrades/104786352
