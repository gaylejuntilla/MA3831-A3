### ** My local files got deleted trying to update this repo because I messed around with git too much :( so this does not have all of the original work (like csv's and embedding files) but with these files this is the order:
1. abc, theguardian, skynews ipnyb's for scraping
2. preprocessing_data
3. NER
4. VADER_and_ELMo
5. source_MLM
